They gave me a full refund instead. I contact them asking why they cannot give me the dress in the smler size because it is in stock so what’s the issue? Told only thing I can do is reorder the dress even though I got it at something like 20% off for a Black Friday de and now it’s back up to full price. Told them I’m not doing that as if need to spend ‘X amount’ more on the higher price and another delivery. Was told they’d give me 10% discount. Not good enough as this was still about £5 more (minimum) than what I’d originly paid and requested an exchange for. I get an email which was supposed to contain a 15% off (I managed to tk them up to 15%) promo code but they never included the discount code in the email. I go to Facebook message them and tell them l this and they say they’ll give me free delivery but they don’t reply for days/weeks at a time and still don’t sent me the discount code!!!! They then have the cheek to say they followed l policies and procedures but I have  BEEN SENT THE PROMO CODE and for some reason even though I’ve repeated myself multiple times and sent them a screenshot of the email with no promo code in it the  customer care team are too stupid to actuly acknowledge this cruci part to my customer care experience. I’ve ‘tked’ to about 5+ people and not one of them acknowledged my messages about not even having been sent the promo code I was promised. Honestly will never buy from them again.\n",

However, this time I’ve received a faulty item so I got in touch with customer care to get a refund. I heard nothing for weeks so got in touch again. Still nothing. My coat was now fling to bits so I got in touch via the live chat, hoping to get a refund as the coat was now out of stock. The person I was speaking to was clearly reading from a script and was not amenable, asking i send back the coat so they could inspect it. I explained I was unable to do this as I don’t have another coat, so I sent pictures of the faults. I was still told that I would need to send the coat back for inspection (it’s 31st December and very cold...!) I suggested I would need to get the coat repaired and this would incur a cost.  reluctantly agreed to help cover the costs of this, provided I do this myself and send a receipt. What a joke. I’ve ready waited weeks with no response to get this quit frankly poor and unhelpful result, with no other compensation for the other time and resource this has incurred on me. To say this is shocking customer service is an understatement, for such a huge organisation and the price I paid for the coat, I would have expected a lot more . Very, very disappointed.\n",

Also the fact that the tracking that is giving is only for “asos shipping reference” (terms used by asos customer service employee) is ridiculous. i have no intention of paying for return shipping. i have never been so frustrated by lack of answers by sever customer service representatives.\n",

Despite two other items being damaged, they have refused to refund them as it was \"only the wax which was faulty\". All customer queries go through the ridiculous '' online chat system, meaning you cannot have a proper conversation with anybody. There is no telephone number or written address available, and if you ask to escate a complaint or speak to a supervisor you will be told \"l complaints are reviewed and det with ternatively\". It is l designed to protect the company rather than help the customer, and to deflect and ignore complaints as much as they possibly can.\n",

      "I used to rely love  customer service but over the last 1 and a hf the service has gone down. They just apologise without giving any solutions or compensation and give timesces. I paid for premier delivery which is £14.99 a year for unlimited next day. I’ve had occasions when the items don’t come next day, I once waited 14 days for an order and then they sent it back to the warehouse in the end (I didn’t ask them to do that). I currently have an order that was due on the 27th in December and they’re telling me it may or may not come on the 3rd and if it doesn’t to contact them. When things like this happen repeatedly customers should have delivery charge refunded straight away. By the time my order comes I won’t even need it for my event. I don’t mind waiting 5-7 working days if Its standard delivery but if I pay for a service and it’s not fulfilled I should get my money back but  customer service think differently. I’m not one to leave bad reviews but I dread contacting  customer service these days because I know exactly what I’m going to get “sorry, wait however long and if it’s not arrived contact us again...” I’m a regular customer and it’s disappointing to see a company you love not treat you as a vued customer.\n",

They would not let me cancel the order since you only get 15 minutes to cancel yet they had me chatting in the customer service chatroom for 30+ minutes and only told me this at the end of our conversation. They then told me I could just return the whole package, which I agreed to. I then went back online and re-ordered EVERYTHING and got one-day shipping (the most expensive option). Come Friday, I get BOTH the one-day and the express orders, so I ordered double for no reason and the customer service lied when they said Monday was the soonest they could ship these items.

My parcel was due to be delivered on the 27th of December and it is now the 28th of December and there is no sign of my parcel. Their customer care has now told me that my parcel could either be delivered on the 30th of December or the 2nd January.

The item arrived today and when I opened it I reised that it was completely different to what I ordered. As I payed for next day delivery you can see my frustration with this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to speak to customer care to see what could be done about this and I spoke to an assistant cled NIMAT. I explained the situation and was told that I needed to return the item and a refund would be given to me. I then asked how long this would take and was told 7 days and I would receive the refund after it has been spent back. Then I told them how much it was including shipping. However, I was then informed that I would not receive a refund for the delivery my order “was delivered on the estimated date”. Which it was, but my order wasn’t delivered... an item that was nothing to what I wanted was delivered. So anyone would expect a full refund as the issue was caused by the supplier. I explained this to NIMAT and was just told the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted this item for New Years and now because  made a mistake I won’t have it now for that time. I’m well aware this may sound petty but it’s not the fact that I won’t receive my money or the fact that I have to go out of my way to return the item, it’s because  has a duty of care to l its customers and I feel like today that wasn’t met.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that no one else has to go through this and I just wanted to share my experience so people can understand. Finly, probably the thing that annoyed me the most was that NIMAT who was supposed to be there to help with my issue ended up ending the chat when I tried asking him another question.\n",

After visiting twitter, I saw on their twitter feed that the cut off was 9pm. Contacted them to cancel the order or confirm that I would have the order the next day, to receive no reply on twitter or Facebook, even though they were replying to messages sent after mine. naged to contact them via their online chat for them to say nothing can be done and that I had to wait for the order to be delivered before refunded even though it was their fault. Tried to email my complaint for it to bounce due to ‘inbox full’. Bad customer service.\n",

When I received the text both my husband and I were at home with our 2 children and not one of us heard the door. Soon as I received the text we checked in l the usu places and the order had not been received. This was on the 11th December. I sent a message to  to confirm this information and after having to confirm my address and that I had checked and confirmed the parcel was not in any of the locations they asked for. I then had a second email asking to confirm these things again. I have finly had an email on the 27th December confirming that I will be able to receive a refund, hopefully this will be completed. I appreciate it is a busy period over Christmas, but I do not have the money especily at this time of year to buy 2 presents for my sister so she has now had no present from me on her 30th birthday.

I am trying to find out how to get my tracking information for a return so I know when I would get my refund. What I det with was the customer rep trying to argue what 10 business days were and that I needed to find proof of postage. First off, regardless of the time period, they could not tell me how I would need to get proof of postage when using the return label that was provided to me in the shipped item. When they could not provide more detail instructions, I confronted with a passive-aggressive, rude customer rep who would be told me that no one could help me.

      "I ordered my parcel and paid for next day delivery so it would be here on  eve in time for Christmas. I left delivery instructions for the parcel to be left in the porch. The dpd driver Harnek  didn’t bother to read the instructions left for the driver and decided to take a picture of my drive. I assume he didn’t even get out his van as there was no sorry we missed you card just a text sayin your delivery won’t come until after Christmas. I tried cling multiple numbers which were l automated voices and no help I phoned  direct and got put on hold then hung up on. I was told I can’t collect it from their depo as the delivery address on my  account had my partners name on with the same address. So after trying everything I could to receive this parcel I gave up as not one person seemed like they wanted to help. I had no choice but to wait for my parcel to be delivered today then get a text today (Friday 27th) saying your parcel will be delivered on Saturday 28th! I did not request this and this is now becoming extremely frustrating. I phoned  to see why this has changed and they put me on hold then hung up on me. I phoned dpd and they told me they can’t help my parcel won’t come today and that  has changed the delivery to tomorrow. I can not be bothered to be put on hold for ages then get hung up on or speak to people that have no intentions to help this is the worst customer care team I’ve ever spoken to and it’s such a shame as I did like ordering from  but after this I won’t be and will send my items back.\n",

I'd sent a message through facebook earlier that day and I'm still waiting a reply. It's now the 27th. The advice now is to wait 48 hours for a replacement order to be processed so god knows when that will be delivered! Instead of keeping customers happy they make excuses for the delivery company. You'd think they would send the replacement order with another company and get it sent next day to make up for it, or even some sort of good will gesture. But no! Absolutely useless.\n",

I don’t even care about the compensation as much as I do the dress. I love that dress and can’t believe you guys took so long to replace it that it sold out.

Have contacted  to ask them to investigate as now 6 days on theres no further update.  dont seem to be concerned that my package is lost with the courier and tell me I have to give it untill the 9th of Jan before they can raise it as a lost parcel as they have to wait for it to come back after 3 failed delivery attempts!!!!  It has not even been attempted once its lost within the courier....... Thats 21 days from order!!!!!! Its clear Hermes have lost the package so why it takes 21 days to be able to claim is beyond me.  customer care is a big fat 0. I'll order elsewhere\n",

No parcel arrived after ages waiting  before as, no refund, no communication, hours trying to sort online and  staff contradicting each other. One day they promise a refund, then they claim being delivered, then nothing, then back to they will speak with courier, then nothing. Avoid. Just buy things in a shop! I have no goods, no xmas presents, no refund, no explanation. This has been going on for weeks!!!\n",

The customer service process is a bit of an annoying loop until you can speak to someone after a robot but it was quick if you have an actu issue that’s showing on your orders. It would be good to have an easier process to speak to a member of the team but  was rely helpful. Thanks!\n",

A clear lack of understanding on how to troubleshoot the issue at hand.\n",

I am a premier customer and i told the advisor online when I finly got through, who said there was nothing they could do and they would escate, as I needed an outfit ASAP it was agreed I could set up another account and pay next day delivery and then asos would waive the delivery, however this was this morning at 10am and I have contacted them via chat- can't get through and messaged them on insta and I'm still waiting for a response. Firstly, how can you just block an account and not resolve the issue and how come you don't respond to messages? What is the point of paying for premier package and i cannot get the benefits- ABSOLUTE KE!!!!!! I guess i will stick with shopping with PLT as they reosond to queries via Whats, with no issues.\n",

This is starting to put me off from using  at l as I’ve now had sever items I ordered for a specific event that have not arrived on time despite me ordering weeks prior and then having to spend time attempting to track down the package.\n",

Emailed asos 3 times first 2 replies they repeat \"check obvious places\" there is only so many times over a month you can check w places for a parcel and now it comes to refunding they are not replying back. Disgusting customer service and thieving yodel. Strongly recommend NOT to shop with asos or  was very helpful and everything went fast!\n",

      "I spoke to REI whoever they are and i was very unhappy with their terrible customer service. I then asked for the complaints address so i could write a form complaint and they refused to give it to me. Never have I experienced such terrible customer service. The people on the other end rely have no clue what they are doing or how to resolve issues. I am deeply upset. I would avoid  and go with someone else with better customer service.\n",

The package was not delivered even after 2 days. I wrote to support a couple of times and each time they told me a new delivery date. I still haven't received the parcel. Judging by the reviews on Google, I'm not the only one who got into a similar situation (people have been waiting for two months and still haven't received their goods).  should change their shipping partner if their customers are important to them.\n",

      "OK so I have been an  customer for most a year now. In that time I have placed quite a few orders and I have sent 80% of the items back. Why? Because it seems the  brand are cheap items from China and the sizing is incorrect for English people. My experience have been tops have been too sml and not in line with the size they say they are, but the shoes have been the worst. Blisters on the back of the heels. It was only when I switched away from  brand it stopped. Today was icing on the cake. I am a paid up member for Premiere Next Day delivery, I paid them a tenner for this. They promise next day. OK so I place an order for some clothes to come tomorrow for a party today. Yesterday, Hermes said out for delivery... They never arrived. So not only are Hermes a terrible delivery company but  are too. I spoke to them on their live chat as they will not give out a phone number or an email (another red flag on a poor company) and I said will you either refund or extend my premiere delivery for the next year based on the fact you wasted my whole day waiting in yesterday and I paid for next day service. You wanna know what they said? ... No... lol I said fine, I'll vote with my feet, adios!\n",

I wrote twice to customer support and I was asked to wait a little bit longer that everything is okay and my order is on it’s way as planned. In this order were New year presents for my sister and my best friend. I wrote to customer support again today, and I was told that my order is missing. So everything before it was just a lie from customer support that order is moving, because according to tracking information there was no movement since December 16. So now I left without New year presents. And everything I was “kindly” suggest from Customer-support is to wait like forever until items from my order will be back in stock for replacement and “generous” discount of 20% for full price item for my next order. I asked to replace it with similar items that are in stock. But they refused. And than closed the chat so I couldn’t even reply. YOU CANNOT ACK WITH PEOPLE LIKE THIS!!\n",

      "Absolutely love shopping here but I find it Absolutely ridiculous that they don't state the price when applying the discount. So when issuing a return or a refund they take a discounted price off the price you ready paid, I complained about this and the lady who works there kindly enough shown me what I was going to pay but when I applied the discount, she shown me what I actuly paid ( now this is not stated in your orders or your receipt, only in the office so this is why I couldn't see!) So, If im the one paying for it, I would like to see what im actuly paying for and where my discount actuly lies within the order itself - meaning I would like to know which item received the refund and which item didn't but I cant see this, unless I complain and this is something I don't want to be doing. There is nothing on your website explaining the process so thankyou to the kind lady who did!\n",
      "Please update your website by lowing customers to see what they are actuly going to pay, if a discount is applied and when sending a confirmation email, so state it on here too ( show the buyer the actu price, so when a refund is being issued or q return they don't think they're receiving less than what they originly bought it for and the people in the office won't get the backlash of it l either.)\n",

I was leaving for two months for work in early October and when I left the package had still not arrived. I figured at that point I would get it when I returned from my trip because there was no way the delivery would not come for two months. However, I returned home in early December and the package had still not arrived. I then went to the  website to receive assistance, I was told an investigation would begin with FedEx. I did not hear back from  for two week after that so I reached out again. I was told that the investigation found that FedEx was not able to find my parcel. This information seemed readily available to the customer support representative but no one told me, the customer. I was then told that I could receive a replacement order, however, due to changes in stock level, they may not have everything I ordered and I would be refunded for those products. I do not see why I would order from  again, the order is over three months late, may not have everything I ordered and no addition compensation was even offered, the prices may be good but I feel better off paying extra to actuly get the clothing that I pay for.\n",

There is no accountability from  hence why there is no contact number to speak directly with a customer service rep only the customer care which is an illusion of actuly caring for the customer.

After tracking my order I reized it was coming from the closest warehouse to my location (which is the States) meaning I would be charged with customs. I was unaware of this and I couldn’t find anything clear on the site, I searched up questions about this on google but none were straightforward. It doesn’t matter to be how long my package will be but it would be helpful if I was told it was going to be coming from the States. I don’t understand why there’s no option to get my clothes shipped from the UK, as there will be no customs.\n",

After an hour of tking to an agent, providing them with l the details under the sun of the issue, even photos of the label and l of the incorrect items I had received, the agent gave me ONE MINUTE to reply to their message (they had kept me waiting over 15 minutes ready) as they were mid-way through processing the refund and then disconnected the chat. The next evening, I tried again. This time we managed to get through the whole conversation - again I sent lots of photos of the label, the incorrect items etc (quite a lot of hassle considering this was not my fault and someone had stuck the wrong label on the package!). The agent first wanted to process the return for the incorrect items so I waited patiently for this, and printed out the return label I received on my own printer at home. The agent then said they would sort the replacement items for me and that I would receive an email confirming this. I raised my concerns with the agent after a few minutes that I hadn't received anything but I was assured it would be on its way soon and that I should have my items shortly. They so processed a refund for a sml item that they no longer had in stock, which was fine.\n",
      "Days went by and I still had received no email, but I had sent their incorrect items back the following day after the online chat. I emailed  Customer Services and, on the same day, received an email from  chasing the return and advising that any future returns might be impacted if I don't return their incorrect items immediately.\n",
      "I received an email on Christmas Eve to say that something had gone wrong - do I want a replacement or a refund. I wanted a replacement but I have zero trust anymore and I will  shop with  again. They still have my money, 20 days later. They were only concerned about getting their items back and had no interest in actuly sorting my issue. You can't speak to anyone on the phone and while I'm sure the agents are lovely people, they are more interested in online sml tk than actuly sorting out someone's problems.\n",

I said no this isn’t what I got told; but she wouldn’t take my word, I sent her a screen shot of the woman earlier saying I could have a refund and then she at last did it for me.

I contacted  customer service 3 times over 3 weeks and was told it had been referred to their ‘speciist’ team and to wait for an email. Not once did I hear from them again. After 3 or 4 weeks I registered a dispute through AfterPay.  failed to respond to the dispute and AfterPay then refunded me l monies paid.  did not once acknowledge the order existed, despite receiving payment. All my previous orders have worked out well. I’d suggest if you buy from them never pay them direct, ways through a reliable third party. I’m deleting the  and will never buy from them again.\n",

      "I purchased items that were intended to be a gift for the holidays. First issue, order didn’t arrive on time and I completely understand as company can’t control shipping carriers delays. However, once I did receive order (X-más Eve), upon unboxing, I noticed one item was damaged/broken (tea mug), AND another item was entirely incorrect item that I didn’t purchase. I immediately tried chatting with customer care but to no avail so I went ahead and followed the return process and printed label. After the holidays, I tried reaching back out to customer care to resolve and they asked if I had returned the items, at that time I hadn’t because the shipping carrier was closed due to holiday,  so I asked for refund so I could at least go ahead and replace the item (s) immediately. The rep then said once the carrier was in receipt of the return they could expedite a refund. I totly understood that. We then got disconnected as they even offered a 25% discount but again the chat was disconnected impromptly. (never received coupon code btw). Fast forward to today, I reconnected with chat and requested again a refund as I had the chance to drop items off at shipping carrier. I was then met with conflicting information and repeated a return policy where I have to wait 14 days to Get a refund. This is unacceptable as I was told one thing, then told another. In addition, this is a quity control issue with their packaging/ shipping operations where I was sent the wrong item on top  Of receiving a damaged/faulty item. I would trust business who have no concern to make it right especily with a customer who has spent thousands of dollars with a company. What has happened to reCustomer loyty and service…..??\n",
      "I returned a pair of pants on 11/23/2022 and as of today, 12/28/2022 I am still waiting for a refund. I've spoken with customer service three times in the last two weeks and I've gotten nowhere. They can't seem to provide me with actu proof that my refund has been processed. All I get are emails stating that I have to wait ten business days for the refund to show in my account. I finly got so fed up with the runaround I've been getting that I filed yet another dispute against  with PayP. They have been in possession of my returned goods for over 30 days. There is no excuse for making me wait so long for a refund. I will  buy from them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: after over a month of being given the runaround by their inept customer service representatives, I finly got my refund. I had to file a claim with PayP and they refunded me the money. The ONLY WAY to pay for things with  is to use PayP. If they screw you regarding a refund or if your order never arrives PayP will help recover your money. I've had issues with other companies as well. As long as you document everything regarding your purchase PayP will use that information to force the companies to refund your money. Even though I ultimately got my refund I will  buy from  again.\n",

Finly after 45 minutes i started wiggin and got vulgar..an hour into this she still kept saying “ bear with me” Holy FK’ seriously a shitshow.  Clothes rarely fit, colors are often way off..

I then told the customer service I’d like a refund which they said will be done by the 25th December and guess what? Still nothing from asos and customer service won’t provide a contact number so I’m currently £300 down due to this company with no sight of an end would completely avoid\n",
      "I pay for next day delivery and again  have failed to deliver and ruined my trip and new year outfits, which has caused anxiety. Stop giving the option for next day if you can’t deliver. No good blaming the carrier who used to be Hermes, so you should have researched their track history. You used to use DPD, much better. Cannot trust  and I will be going elsewhere as not reliable.\n",
      "I placed an order on 14th of December for next day delivery. It’s now the 28th of December and I have not received my delivery and have had no correspondence except for me reaching out to the chat team. I have spoke to 3 separate people none who have been any help. I asked for a replacement and was told it would be processed I then got an email to say refund on the way that the product was out of stock. The product is not out is stock as I can clearly order it now. I asked to speak to someone higher and was told it wasn’t possible. I have spent over 1 hour trying to sort out this problem. Absolutely shocking customer service and poor behaviour from asos. It’s no wonder  have to keep having discounts, why would anyone want to order from such a bad company\n",

      "Like other recent reviews have stated. Everything with asos has gone significantly downhill. A lost large parcel of clothes I’d ordered for my husbands birthday and a month later and no delivery. I’ve spoken to them on 4 occasions over this month and they would not refund and continuly dismissed my request to escate this to a form complaint. They instead kept giving robotic fse empathic responses (evidently not genuine and part of their training - I work in ment heth empathy only has the deescation result if it’s authentic and genuine - and there’s re action to rectify the situation) and kept telling me to wait. Eventuly after a month agreed to give me a refund as the courier had confirmed it was lost and had the audacity to say they were ‘willing to give me a refund because I was a loy customer’ erm no that’s the bare minimum in line with my consumer rights. A ruined birthday and no compensation for hours and hours of time and energy spent trying to get it sorted. Shockingly bad asos rely. H&M lost a parcel of mine and they were amazing in comparison, I got a refund straight away (within days) no questions asked and they said if my parcel showed up just to keep it (it didn’t) and they so gave me a 20% voucher for the inconvenience.  take note, I’ll be shopping at H&M over you l the time now\n",

No cust service phone #, chatbots won't connect you to a person AND their website says that you can return items by logging into your account, clicking on the order and selecting 'return'. This won't work because you won't find your order there. Surprise! VERY BAD and DISHONEST.\n",

But 20% off for  I made a huge mistake did a big order with them on 13th December I have premier deliver couldn’t possibly go wrong again. Yes no parcel arrived EVRI confirmed it’s lost but every day come back to us for a refund tomorrow.   They lie and lie over and over again. So no  gifts for my daughter now the 28th and no refund.

Returned on 15th as had no use for it any longer. Dec 28th “ they have received it back but haven’t processed it in the warehouse yet” I have to wait until dec 31st when I have to contact them again myself to ask for a manu refund if it has been processed. WTH !!! That is 36 days from order to processing which can then take 10 days to show a refund. Are you having a laugh  .. it’s 2022!!!  I sell clothing online and  delivers next day around Ireland if I have a return it’s back to me next day following return date and I refund immediately. Shocking customer care from a company, just shocking..  again!!! Account will be closed as soon as I receive my refund .

      "What has happened to ? Having been a customer for a long time and had great service to been on the receiving end the past few months of some simply shocking episodes. The most recent an order placed on 14/12 with next day delivery due through premier delivery. Well as you have probably guessed asos decided to send this via EVRI so even now as I write this review (24/12) the parcel has not arrived. Spoke to asos through their chat system and was told on 20/12 that a message would be sent to EVRI to chase up my parcel and if I hadn’t heard anything by 22/12 to contact them back and either a refund or replacement would be issued. Nothing received so on the 23/12 I contacted asos again however this time was told I had to leave it until cob that day and to contact them on 24/12 if no update received and again I would be either given a refund of replacement. I contacted the online chat again today and was told I now need to leave it until 01/01/2023 and if the parcel doesn’t arrive I can then contact asos and they will arrange a refund. So basicly I have to wait 18 days before I can be given a refund on the off chance that EVRI decide to deliver my parcel. arently you cannot log a complaint through asos despite the website saying to contact the chat facility to log a complaint and the colleagues on the chat might as well just not answer as it’s utterly useless. I’ve ended up requesting a chargeback through my bank so I would expect asos to be receiving notification of this shortly. If anyone from asos is reading these reviews then I would advise that some major changes need to be made as from\n",

As they did not arrive on time I requested a refund which took a number of messages to  before it was agreed and finly received. The parcel eventuly arrived on Christmas Eve. As an honest person I immediately contacted  and said I was pleased it had arrived in time for Christmas and could I now please pay. The only option I was told was to return the items. I explained I didn’t want to return the items I wanted to keep them and just pay for them. After a long conversation with ‘customer care’ including being told I could reorder with next day delivery and still get them for Christmas! To which I did ask them if they were in fact Santa Claus! Since it took more than 2 weeks to get the delivery I suggested this perhaps might not happen and I would like to give my daughter her presents on Christmas Day. I offered to pay sever times and was threatened that if I did not return the items then my future refunds would be impacted. I would  use  again. Be warned!!\n",

I used the online chat to find out what was happening and to change the polo t shirt for the correct colour so it would be here for Christmas. I have been fobbed off and told not to use  again.

My order was originly $200, none of the items on se, but when I got to  the checkout and I noticed no promo and I HAD MAKE AN ACCOUNT with them just to place my order, I removed some items because I was a bit tilted by that. It's my first time ordering from here, I don't even know if what I got will fit me correctly since a I'm 6'1 feme, so it was a bit discouraging.

      "However, despite responding to an e-mail from  on the 21st of December, in which I was advised that the courier company () wanted me to wait an addition 10 days(!) for them to locate my order, I responded to  with an unequivoc no & requested an immediate full refund. 2 days later no response from! It is only today (the 23rd), following corresponding via their chat service & making the threat of a form complaint to the FCA if my money wasn't refunded immediately & not in 2023 (which was how long they were expecting me to wait!), did I subsequently 10 minutes later, receive confirmation that my money is being refunded back to me (thank God I paid using PayP!). I strongly suggest that  use another courier company, as EVRI's service is & ways has been diabolic & clearly no amount of rebranding (they were previously cled Hermes) is going to change that!\n",

      "I ordered a coat on Thursday 15th December and paid for next day delivery, when the item failed to turn up by the Monday (3 days later) I tried to contact customer service, they don’t make that process easy - presumably on purpose. On Monday I spoke to someone via webchat who said I needed to wait till tomorrow, if it still didn’t arrive they’d process a refund. Tuesday I joined the awful webchat again, this time I was told to wait until midnight. Wednesday joined the webchat again and this time I was told they’ve raised it with  and to give them 2 working days. Friday I joined webchat again and this time I was told I need to wait 10days, I’ve ready waited 7 by the point. I paid next day delivery which I was then told is not guaranteed - why have it as an option then! It was a £30 coat and £10 delivery, l this for the sake of £40! It’s now the princip as I refuse to be scammed. Just refund the money, hire competent staff and take it up with evri. Whole experience has been horrendous.\n",

Nothing arrived contacted via the chat line sever times, emails and chat line as only way to chase an order.  Told they were sure it would arrive before Christmas.  23rd December nothing arrived, contacted the  Line and told by Shashank that I would not get a refund until the 26th as I had to wait a full 10 days and the origin order was placed on the 7th.  I explained that the order has not arrived prior to Christmas and it is a gift,I would like a refund today and he said there would be no refund until the 26th.

When I attempted to return them, I discovered that I now have to cover the return costs. While this was a bit of a letdown, I decided to trust , given my years of being a loy customer. Placed another order only to teceive l those items in the WRONG size again! Now, I have to go through the process of another return, and pay for it? I don't think I will be placing any more orders in the near future.\n",

When I purchased the item, I did so on the basis that the   page said that Christmas orders could be returned till 15 January.  When I opened my wet package, the delivery note stated that it should be returned within 28 days, which meant I could not keep it until Christmas.  I then had a very frustrating online chat session with customer services to try to clarify the contradictory advice given, but so far to no avail.  It is a shame, as the garment is just what I was looking for for my son.  Sadly, he now won't get it.\n",

My item still hasnt arrived, and when I spoke with the chat team they said \"I would like to inform you that we have changed the next day delivery to fastest delivery for temporary basis due to high volume of orders and it is temporary but It will be change to next day delivery soon in next couple of days.\"\n",

Two weeks later and over 3 hours text tking to customer care’ and nothing has been done! s have not been refunded or replaced and less than a month before  I cannot get my money back.

The Website is buggy, codes run out whenever they want them to, you get kicked out off the website often, the prices are sometimes even more expensive than the origin retail price which you could get on Amazon. At l costs, please avoid . Do not buy anything off them you will cost yourself unnecessary stress.\n",

      "Don't think I've ever encountered such shoddy and careless customer service. Ordered £300s worth of items for next day delivery and still no sign of my delivery.  stuck the blame on the carrier and had no updates for me, I had to continuously chase them and was repeatedly told my order would arrive the next day but here we are one week later and still nothing. I had to go out of my way to contact them constantly and ended up putting in another order. Lack of professionism, urgency and empathy - happy to take your money though.\n",

      "If you miss the rerun date with a day because you’re sick they will ask for a doctors note and say sorry can’t help you. 1 day! Things happen to everyone and there is no flexibility in what they do or try to support you as a customer. Now I have a brand new shoes too big to be used because I tried to return these 1 day too late! Definitely not using  ever again.\n",
      "Blocked my account randomly with no explanation. I have been a loy customer for over 10 years, ordering parcels at least 2/3 times a month since 2014. No email to let me know why it has been blocked and I have so paid repeatedly for premier delivery over the years, which now I do not have access to use. Very appling customer service and disappointing! AVOID at l costs, customer care team unhelpful!!\n",
      "It’s not great initily trying to make contact but when I finly got to chat with someone, I was able to resolve my issue and the customer advisor was very polite and helpful.\n",
      "Don’t pay for premium. They send you mouldy clothes. Orders  arrive on time and oh yeah they still use evri who are known for their rubbish standards and never deliver on time.\n",
      " returns policy needs to be updated so people aren’t set up! The policy states items can be returned within 28 days. It does not state this has to be full priced items and therefore easy to assume it is l. The next paragraph tks about returns from Hong Kong, then the paragraph after that tks about se items. I am unable to return over $200 worth of items because I am outside the 14 day. I checked the returns policy and stopped reading at the first paragraph considering it didn’t state full priced only and the next paragraph tked about a different country so I didn’t scroll down. I’m so annoyed and upset with this. I request your policy be re-written to make it clear it is 28 days for full priced items and 14 for se in the se paragraph so other people don’t lose their money like I did. This experience plus having to pay for returns means that this once loy customer is probably never going to shop with  again.\n",

They started high brands which we buy a lot and our last orders we sent some return as size is very big . They audacity of asos mailed us we did not return properly . It mean we used it . This is new way to sell customers forcefully and it’s a proper scam and unfair trade . They cloth we never wore even tired not even a minute to see the fitting it’s very big but how dare they say they are sending us back .\n",

I contacted them what turned out to be a few days after the returns period to ask for a new code, however they said because I had tried to use the code multiple times then it didn't work. Although it had never worked, and had I contacted them a few days earlier then they would have been able to help. Seems unfair considering I had tried multiple times to return, only to be told I couldn't because I reached out too late.\n",

Recently I bought the biggest order I've ever made worth £350 in time for a weekend away I was going on. The order arrives and I'm missing 3 pairs of shoes, but I try everything else on and decide I like the necklace I ordered, but the other shoes and clothes I picked didn't suit me, and I intended to send them back as per my statutory rights. I report the missing shoes with  customer care, who apologize and ask whether I want a refund or a replacement, to which I ask for a refund. My request is passed to their speciist team, who send me an email 10 hours later to say that my account has been blocked for suspicious activity?? So just because I made a big order and didn't receive some of it, I now cannot return items I tried on and never wore. Please unblock my account so I can return items I am entitled to return!!\n",

      "Very poor experience when having to return shoes due to them fling apart only 2-3 months after buying. In the end I returned the shoes twice, did not receive a refund and did not get my shoes back either. Multiple chats with agents over a few months got me nowhere. Very disappointed.\n",

      "BUYER BEWARE! Read the return policy carefully.  If your not sure about the size, then order 2 of different sizes. Customer service is lacking and no phone number.  Just a chat online. Not very good customer support at l. I had ordered 2 expensive jackets by thier size chart and they were to big. So I have to return those then order the other ones in the correct size separately. They were then more money than what I paid for originly.   be warned.\n",
      "Great until you need to speak to someone. The customer service on the live chat is terrible and not worth the bother.

Contacted customer services and now because the 28 days returns days have passed, they cant raise another reutrn, even though the return was registered on time and tried to return on time but THEIR label didnt work. Customer service was absolutely shocking and worst I have expereinced in a long time, with absoultey no attempt to try and resolve the situation other than copied and pasted messages and broken english. Wont ever use asos again and will warn others not to as well.\n",
      "I am from Ity. I bought a dress on se. I wanted to return it and I discovered I couldn't do it because they changed the return policy and instead of writing it on the returns page they write it at the bottom of the order confirmation email. And so I lost my money. Thank you !\n",

I have no idea why this has happened, I have never had issues ordering online prior. I then tried to log in to see if I had enough time to reorder; account locked due to suspicious activity. No email or phone number or any reasonable way to contact asos, just a web chat. This web chat was quite useless and basicly said a team will get in touch after investigating. I am now clearly not going to receive my order within the time I need it, and the refund will take up to 10 working days to come back into my account so I actuly can’t afford to go elsewhere.\n",

With regards to the premier delivery, I have been told I can have a 'refund' on that but I will not have premier access anymore so that's a waste of time. I spoke for over an hour and got absolutely nowhere. I refuse to believe that a company as big as  has no way of processing a refund other than the standard process on the system.\n",

They will not help you with more details or expediting delivery etc. In fact they do nothing but read out your order details. It is sad that  is paying for these chatterboxes who are misfit for purpose.\n",
      "Shame I can't rate 0. Customer service team on chat think it's acceptable to end a chat and another thinks it's acceptable to just stop responding. They refused to put me through to a nager or PayP nager. PayP and my bank both say  is at fault and needs to cancel the transaction within their PayP, but they don't want to acknowledge it.\n",

      "Ordered 2 pairs of NB trainers, sizes 6.5 and 7 as unsure which size would fit. Returned the 6.5 as too sml, perfect condition and well packaged for the return. Used their returns corrier , received email confirmation of receipt then nothing for 3 weeks. Chased them up to be told the returned item was in an unacceptable condition (absolutely untrue) and the item had been returned to me (so untrue). Their online chat was painfully slow 1 hour, 20mins, and a tot waste of time. For the last 30 mins transferred to a manager, equly slow and useless, only able to tell me they would email an update, I'm not holding my breath.\n",
      "HOLY ****\n",
      "i placed an order (because i forgot i wouldn't order there anymore) I received the items and want to return some of them. I go to the website to do the return.. follow the steps.. i enter in l the info.. it shows \"ups is having technic issues try again later\". I do so .. multiple times for multiple days. I finly reach out to customer service for a return label.. i am told the system is down come back later today. I do so... over the span of three weeks and 4 chats later. i keep getting told there is nothing they can do just to message them again before december 8th (that's when i am out of my return period) Now i'm tired of waiting because their return system has never worked for me and if it hasn't worked the last three weeks for them why should it the next time I message them. I ask for the USA return address ready ready to pay for the return. They are not providing me with the info only the UK return address are not offering refund for shipping or ANYTHING. And when I ask what is going to happen if the system still isn't working by dec 9th (day after return time frame) the question is ignored and i am told again to wait.\n",
      "I am SOO done with this company and you should be too.  experiences.\n",
      "Absolutely shocking! Feels like you don’t even speak to a re person! Had to report fraud due to the lack of communication.\n",
      " was most helpful, great asset to your company\n",
      "I have been placing orders from  for years now and I have had no issues.  However, earlier today I was left feeling cheated and disappointed.  I was about to purchase a jacket which was included in their Cyber Monday promotion.  The discount code had applied but due to to the fact that my order exceeded 500 sterling, I had to split my order in two.  In the meantime, this particular jacket was removed from the promotion and the discount code would now not apply! I went back to the promo filtering and it had been removed.   This jacket has been included in the promotion since earlier this morning! This is cheating to say the least.  To add insult to injury after speaking to the customer care representative for nearly an hour he basicly said there was nothing he could do about and ended the chat when I pointed out that this is clearly 's mistake and it should be rectified - pointless customer care service!\n",
      " was responsive and very helpful with my query\n",
      " is so helpful & kind! Amazing custom service.\n",
      "chat support could barely use English, did not resolve the problem, said someone else would fix it without giving a time frame, reference or anything else\n",
      " customer service is designed to make you give up trying to get assistance. When you do actuly get to speak to a re person they have procedures which make it hard for the customer. Just don’t bother with them.\n",
      "If I could give zero stars I would! Ordered a NF jacket for my daughter never arrived, trying to get someone to help is an absolute nightmare! Contacting them daily now and still no further forward. Have asked for a refund refused asked for a replacement to be sent next day delivery to be told oh depends on stock. I checked stock prior to contact. They give you zero confirmation. Now 18 days after ordering I still have no jacket for my daughter and I’m £220 out of pocket! Never again will I use this company! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!\n",
      "had a great experience with customer service today spoke to a guy named  he was very helpful and efficient couldn't of asked for anymore.\n",
      " return policy is not consumer friendly. I tried to return an item 29 days after receiving it and was denied because of its strict 28 day policy. This is less generous that nearly every other online retailer, which offers AT LEAST 30 days. The items I received were of poor quity and not what I expected. I won't be ordering anything from this company again.\n",
      "If I could give a zero i would. The jumper I ordered had a pink dot on it when i first placed the order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Returned it an they offered me a measly 20% discount which they were actuly offering online! - pathetic\n",
      "\n",
      "Reordered the same item again which was delayed by another week and guess what?! They sent me the same jumper with the same pink dot and exactly the same way I packed it!\n",
      "\n",
      "What an absolute joke - Never ordering from  again and will tell everyone about my experience too\n",
      "My order query was successfully det with\n",
      "Prompt and had l the facts related to my issue without me having to explain which is actuly very rare so I appreciated this very much\n",
      " used to be a good store that sold quity clothes. Now, the quity of clothes is very poor. I bought four jackets, and three of them had to be returned due to poor quity, and I had to pay for the return shipping.\n",
      "Very helpful and sorted refund straight away for missing item\n",
      "Never rely on their next day delivery! I've ordered on Sunday 26th, 12.30 day time,and supposed to be delivered Monday 27th Nov. It was Tuesday 28th evening when i contacted them, and just said, sorry, is on it's way, just keep waiting. I did paid extra money for premier delivery, and they admitted that was their mistake, when they dispatched my item in the day that should be delivered, and apologies. It's been ready 3 days and still waiting for my order, and l that they do is just say sorry and wait one more day. So why we pay for next day delivery when actuly is like 3 or maybe more  pay for a service that doesn't do what it says. Is understandable maybe 1 day, but 3?when we pay extra for this? No way! So don't order relying that you get next day delivery! I've got proof and I'm willing to take this matter further. When I've asked why is this happening, they said, well we try to improve based on people opinions. So we, as customers, what do we get? A sorry, and keep waiting. Writing them a complaint, \"improving\" their business, do not help us, we pay for the next day delivery, and we do expect it so. They use Roy mail and blame on it.\n",
      "I spend roughly about £1000 a year with this company however, I will not spend a single penny more due to the fact that I was sent a pair of trainers that had a mark on and these trainers were £100 I went to the live chat to try and resolve it as I was not in a position where I could return it due to going abroad. The following day, they didn’t want to know and we’re very very unhelpful and condescending. and didn’t seem that bothered about losing a customer…. no wonder the company is struggling there are companies that have moved with the times and have ternative resolutions other than just a simple return, which isn’t ways possible.\n",
      "Fed up the ‘next day’ delivery service you offer and not getting it next day.\n",
      "Never in my time as an adult have I ever witnessed a company that refuses to sell me anything after failing a 'security check' and when chlenged to state that any further correspondence would be automaticly deleted.  I have a credit score of 999 and the payment card used went through vidation and the transaction was marked as pending.  It is unfathomable and quite bizarre - good luck - I do hope you eventuly cease trading.\n",
      "Returned some items to receive an email saying they have closed my account due to suspicious activity and my refund won’t be issued. Nothing more than thieves and I will be taking this down the leg route.\n",
      "So I ordered a parcel to my old address by accident (I’m aware that’s my fault and I hold my hands up to that) HOWEVER! Once I reised about 10 minutes after I tried to change the address to my current address. Unfortunately  seems to be living in 2001 and doesn’t low its customers to change their address. So I tried to cl , turns out their phone lines are permanently closed(brilliant). So I then finly managed to find a way to contact them via a chat. I asked to change the address and was told I could only do this before the order is confirmed. Well orders are confirmed instantly so that’s a load of rubbish. I then asked if they could cancel the order and re order it to my new address, they wasn’t capable of doing that either (shock). So I then decided to cancel the order myself as it was becoming such a pain. I then thought that would be that but no how stupid was I to think that. A few hours went by and I still hadn’t received my confirmation email to confirm my parcel was cancelled, so I chased them. I was told it would take a few hours. A few hours passed and you guessed it still nothing. So again I chased them and was told it would take 24 hours. It has now been well over 24 hours so I chased them for a third time. This time I was told the parcel intact won’t be cancelled and I will be receiving it at my old address!!! What an absolute joke! So now I have to go to my old address and collect it.\n",
      "Patient and thorough customer service from  and Pooja. I rely appreciated their support.\n",
      "They use skynet to deliver to Qatar. Upon delivery i was charged 20£ to collect my package.£5 custom fees (which is fine). But £15 in broker fees and handling fees? Tried escating to customer service chat but Durghesh decided to end the chat because he didnt know how to address the issue. Uninstling and never buying from asos\n",
      " so resolve something entirely not my fault but staff very polite\n",
      " was extremely helpful and sorted my issue straight away!\n",
      "I have never experienced such maddening, infuriating, and impossible service. UNACCEPTABLE.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to return an item via an online form, but it offered no options from Germany (!). Three weeks after contacting numerous agents, bypassing useless AI, and wasting hours trying to solve the most straightforward issue, I gave up.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the agents managed to create a label manuly, and each time, after doing the same old dance and repeating myself to oblivion, they would say, \"we are unable to process a return due to a technic issue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They cannot generate a return label via Hermes (due to said technic issue), and the other carrier they offer is NON-EXISTENT in Germany (Instabox pulled out in October 2022), lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "After explaining this to them a thousand times, I got forwarded to managers. Each time, and after an hour of repeating myself, they would finish the conversation with \"we are escating this to our escating team and will get back to you via email.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No one ever does, ofc. They have no contact number one can cl, nor do they have an email for offici complaints or otherwise. Their customer service is designed to drive you insane and have you give up. It's a dead end.\n",

      "A proper scam! :/\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Blocked my account, gave no reasoning or warning. Failed to give an explanation when asked. Customer service is shocking. You go round in circles.\n",
      "When there’s no issue, you’re great, when there’s an issue you’re just SO UNHELPFUL.\n",
      "Was emailed to say that delivery will arrive at a certain date/time and now they're saying it'll be delivered a min of another week later which will be pointless because I'd ordered a whole outfit ($500+) for an event that would have happened ready\n",
      "I’ve spent thousands over the years and have ways loved asos. This week Monday I bought some wellies on next day delivery that I need for a charity event. It’s Saturday and I’ve not received so went through asos chat. The advisor admitted there’s delivery issues because of Black Friday and next day delivery is no longer an option when buying. But it was when I bought and I therefore asked for a refund. The advisor so admitted they probably won’t be delivered by Tuesday but I have to low them 2 working days to get a reply from the courier. The event I’m attending will be over then so I’m going to have to buy another pair whilst asos still have my money. Poor show asos and I’m not going to be using you again. I’d forgive the error with advertising the next day delivery and letting me pay for it but the after service when your delivery time has not been met through your own fault is appling. Addition your hat advisor cancelled the chat because I wouldn’t accept the situation. I was not rude and still had questions.\n",
      "…\n",
      "Customer service was very helpful and quick to solve my problem.\n",
      "Very poor customer service. I was charged for shipping fee despite the information on the website that says it is free. They are not able to help you. They lie to get ride of you or close the window. Same experience two times.\n",
      "I ways shop with asos they are excellent excellent service l the time please keep up the excellent service asos thanks to l the asos teams kind regards\n",
      "Watch out when ordering with a discount code. If you send something back due to bad quity or damages, which happens often with  clothing, and you fl just slightly beneath the amount necessary for the discount code,  has introduced a new practice where they deduct the full discount amount of every single item from your refund. In my case, it would have been cheaper to keep the returned items because  refunded me only a fraction of what I paid for them. I contacted them and tried to reason because I reordered the sent back items in a different size but it seems like they have changed their business model recently and don’t vue a customer anymore. I have been a client for more than 7 years but  has changed for the worse.\n",
      "My order was not delivered,  I’m paying  premier for the speci delivery service  ,made an order on 26th of November and on 29th of November still has not received. Contacted customer service and they can’t do anything about it ,just keep telling me to contact them later    If it will be not received ,so my question is why I’m paying  premier service charge ? What’s the point of that service then ? my order was for the speci event so now it’s l will be cancelled ,as my outfit has not arrived, that’s why I’m paying for this asos premier service to get the next day delivery , to be covered and so I ordered couple days in advance and still not arrived.I strongly don’t recommend to pay for your asos premier as you will not receive promised items on time and so the customer service will not help you with this and so if you want to raise a complaint with them just be aware that they don’t have any complaints department,this what the agent said to me on the chat.If you consider to buy asos premier just be aware that you can be in the same position as me  .\n",
      "Rely good customer service, helped resolve my order rely quickly\n",
      "I have received terrible customer service for your chat line. I originly ordered from your site 14 days ago and have been back and forth with 3 customer advisors 2 of which said my package would be here now, both said that the order was being fulfilled to find out the package is actuly lost and had never left the  despite it saying on the app it was on its way. I was so told that my parcel was on its way and the chat advisor even said it had next day delivery... That was most a week ago. I'm rely unhappy with the service I've received. Now I have to wait 10 working days for a refund, I can't afford to wait 10 days :(terrible service\n",
      "Hamza was so helpful great customer service!!!!\n",
      "USE ANOTHER COMPANY THAT VALUES YOUR BUSINESS- Terrible customer service, this company has no idea what they’re doing. They’ve taken my order, which they can’t even find. They keep asking me to wait 24 hours and then 48 hours. Then longer it’s ridiculous!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company service levels aren’t as they used to be!\n",
      "Would give 0 if it were possible.  have changed their carrier making it absolutely impossible to get anything delivered and they take absolutely zero accountability for this!! I for one will be speaking with my feet and never ordering from them again! Don’t waste your time getting on to Customer Service….. Absolutely useless\n",
      "Having been using  since 2017, they have randomly blocked my account? It has happened to others, check . I so pay for the premium delivery, and they now want me to pay to send my returns back? Ridiculous\n",
      "My accounts been blocked with no explanation, I shop a lot on asos but like any norm person I do returns either stuff down for, not as described or simply dosnt suit me, I’ve paid for next day delivery and so have gift cards I carnt use as it work let me shop\n",

      "I’m not sure where to start…customer service-the worst experience ever!!! No manners, no profession skills, rude and very unpleasant to tk to. Ending the chats in middle without resolving the issue in 3 different occasions, regarding the same order. So disrespectful, absolutely unbelievable. My issue still not resolved!!!!\n",
      "This shop is the worst. I ordered sever jumpsuits for my wedding, but because I am quite tl, none of them fitted. I did not receive my money back for one of them, because they claim it was used. All tags are still on the piece and obviously I did not wear it, but because there is a ca. 2mm stain on the INSIDE that might have come from trying it on, they are now saying it cannot be accepted and I lose over 230€.\n",
      "I know law is on my side and I should get a lawyer, but I am sure asos will just bury everything with counterarguments until I give up so not worth investing my time and energy into this. Obviously I should have checked the rating here first, but I guess from now on I know.\n",
      "Very efficient and helpful. Resolved my problem with no issues. Thanks again!\n",
      "Very nice conversation, thank you for your help!\n",
      "I have had a previous issue with  before when I was sent used shoes but I let that slide as it was just the bottom of the shoes. I placed an order that had the promo code applied, after checking out, I reized I was charged the full amount.  claimed they have a speciist team that des with those issues and I should be patient and wait a reply, after the agent gave me a cheeky comment of ‘ I like proactive customers like you’, I honestly wasn’t sure how to take this.After asking numerous times for a time sce on the speciist team getting back to me in regards to the issue, I was then told “no time sces can be given”. After doing a quick search and seeing a number of people had the same issue and after receiving their order,  refused to do anything about it, I asked for my order to be cancelled, I was told I could do it from my end but I had no options to do that. I was then told that I could no longer cancel the order and that I had to wait to receive my order and then process a return and then wait to receive a full refund.it is indeed sad to see  go downhill like this and reading l the numerous reviews left, it’s obvious that the customer is no way a focus of this once beloved company.\n",
      "Customer service was quick and very helpful.  was the kindest, fun and helpful. We need more people like  :)\n",
      "First order, sizes correct, delivery fast, cannot fault !\n",
      " no longer viable. I’m a premium member since it’s introduction, but last year I was on the fence about renew because of the change of terms and the temporary remov of express post. This year scraping free returns on top of the increased minimum spend - it’s no longer viable as my go-to store. You need to have consistent and accurate sizing if you’re going to force customers down this route. Previously the risk was with  when they misrepresent sizing, now they’ve flipped it and charge the customer to return clothing because of their misrepresentation of items. I so did my first paid return, received by  on 9/10 and still no refund 2 weeks later, but they’re now giving themselves a month to accept your return. I’m sure I’m not the only one who’s given the premium feature a miss this year but I so can’t see myself buying from  again.\n",
      "Great customer service gave me a refund for items not received\n",
      "Awful customer service. Received a faulty item. Had to return it on request of the  team in order to receive a refund. I returned it but it was rejected as a return because it was outside the 28 day return period. The customer service rep said this might happen but to give the helpdesk my chat reference number to issue the refund. After a second hour long chat conversation where they said this chat reference couldn't be found and didn't listen / understand the situation, they asked me to return the item. An item that I had ready returned! So they sent it back to me, to return again and repeat the process. When repeating this process the same thing happened l over again, with their chat representative saying they couldn't see any conversation regarding a refund. Luckily i took screenshots. After a painful process, they said they have issued a refund but can't provide a timeline or email confirmation!\n",

      "I immediately went to the customer service chat and they told me that this decision had been taken at the \"highest escation\" (whatever that means). I asked for an explanation and was told they couldn't give me one because my account had been closed. At this point it's bordering on a weird -esque nightmare. My returns get lost/stolen and for some unknown reason my account gets cancelled and  decides to keep my £355.88 (sounds a bit like fraud to me) - but they won't tell me why.\n",

By covering themselves with a policy I don’t even know if it’s leg ? They offer so many discounts ( today everything 10% off) and when you add that discount later when you are asking to refund they don’t refund full amount. Example I paid £80 for 2 items and I got refund £62.40 how that’s that work? That I lost the rest of the money? Never ever again I am buying anything from them! Be very careful! It cause me a lot of stress which is not needed at l!\n",

      "I have hung on to  for so long, hoping they will acknowledge their negative customer feedback and make improvements as the \"old\"  seemed faultless. However, as they move towards a 'fast-fashion' brand rhetoric by, in my opinion, churning out cheap and poor quity products that never fit correctly and 99% of the time do not arrive at the date promised or even the date paid for when you pay for a faster delivery service! This l in an effort to fill their greedy pockets with more and more money. I nearly gave up when I found out they'd partnered with / Hermes, due to their renowned negative reputation, and had multiple parcels delayed and some completely displaced. Still, I remained loy and chose not to give up. Every company has to save cost somewhere, right? A cheaper courier makes sense. But no, this budget cutting method has affected the quity of the products, the quity of customer service, website usability etc. The whole thing just feels cheap and rubbish. It seems like not even that long ago, buying from  felt like a treat! This was reflected by the high quity of products they sold and the excellent delivery, returns and afterses service. Now just a distant memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today was my last straw. I accidently cancelled a 2-part order in full when rely, I only wanted to cancel 1 item on the order. There was no option to do this and the whole process was very confusing. When I spoke to Sarrahmay, she told me it was not possible to reverse this. So I went to rebuy the product and had a 10 minute back and forth with her about product availability, because she hadn't bothered to check that the size I wanted was back in stock. I then missed the Black Friday offer of 20% discount. When I got in touch today, I requested if this could be price-matched to my previous order. It took  hf an hour to tell me this was impossible. I was then randomly passed on to another ses advisor, , who again, stated that his systems would not low him to generate a discount code. Absolute nonsense. One of the many reasons I have purchased from  was due to their excellent afterses service that has hugely declined in the last few years. They used to generate good will discount codes on many occasions, which gave me enough faith to continue purchasing with them. Please bear in mind, this was to match a purchase I had ready made, so they were losing NOTHING by giving me this discount. When I requested for this to be escated to a supervisor, I was refused and told to go back on live chat later (so now it has become the customer's responsibility to resolve their own issue). I so asked for a complaints contact and was, again, refused. There is no avenue to escate issues and everything has been designed to put money first and customers last. You can clearly see this by the shocking state of their customer reviews, that continues to worsen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't tell you not to buy from . In fact, I implore you to buy from them just once. Once is l you'll need to put you off  for life.\n",

      "In the end, I found the product elsewhere with a 25% discount and free next day delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you would like to spend your money only to receive a faulty, poorly made product, that you may never actuly receive, from a company that is impossible to contact, with afterses teams (of whom I'm convinced are trained only in sickly sweet hellos and goodbyes, and fobbing off the customer) to end up resolving your own order issues, then this is definitely the retailer for you.\n",

      "The most awful customer service experience. You have seriously gone down hill . I had a parcel come today damaged with 2 items in, was agreed after speaking to an advisor for 30 minutes that they were rely sorry and they would replace/refund both items to me and there was no reason to return, I thought this was great. When I got my confirmation of refund I reised they had selected the wrong item, which was of a lower vue. I contacted again but this time told it wasn’t within their policy and the previous advisor was wrong to have agreed that and that they would not honour that agreement. I have been told to return the item, but I have no packaging to return it in as the delivery box was damaged on arriv and  have told me on asking to put in a form complaint, that they have no complaint process. Deeply disappointed with this company, nothing is packaged safely, customer service atrocious and they just go back on their word and argue with you.\n",

      "This clause of using asos discount codes has not been made known at l and I think is very sneaky. I never write reviews but I wanted to make sure other people are aware of this so they don't end up with an unexpected full priced bill (after returning part of their order) after using a discount code when the order was placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After using asos for years I have  seen this before. I ordered sever different black trousers and shirts for work uniform and applied the 15 discount code to get a 15% discount for spending over £150. When I then returned the pairs that I didn't want/that didn't fit and went to pay for the remaining products (on ) that I had kept, l products were billed as fully priced and not discounted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking it was an error I contacted customer service and was told it was because the order was now not over £150 as I had returned items from the order so the discount now couldn't apply????\n",
      "\n",
      "So ridiculous !! When the order was placed it was over that amount, just because I sent a couple of items back - now they somehow can retract the discount? I would not have kept the items if I knew they were full price and I cannot send them back now as I have used them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand not discounting my refund with the entire orders discount but SOME discount should come off relative to how much is kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not happy at l with  and everyone that I have told about it has been shocked as they hadn't heard of this clause either. At a time when everyone is relying on discounts as times are tight, I feel many others are going to get caught with the same clause and be forced to pay full after ordering under the illusion of 's sneaky little 'discounts'.\n",
      "Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with , I have returned 2 items in one package  and I was only refunded for one. The customer agent told me I have to wait a further 10 days. Then he stated the problem is with my bank. And told me to check my bank. There is no problem with my bank. As I clearly sow the refund for one of the items. The customer agent said that they will provide me a refund email. Then  2 minutes later goes on to say he actuly can’t do it. I have never been provided with an email confirming refund. The customer service experience  I have had with  has been a nightmare. I never thought that getting a refund would be such a headache. Staff need to be further trained. When asked how to make a complaint they said there is no email or option. I have now been told there was an error with payment and they need to process a nnu refund. Agent said he need to contact speciist then didn't hear from me for more than a minute then disconnected with no action plan or telling me next steps. After I was on the live chat for nearly an hour. And throughout the majority of the chat I was told it was my bank error and to wait a moment. Only for them to turn around and say they made a mistake.  what will you do to fix this i would like my money back?\n",
      " very helpful on chat when I had a query.\n",
      "I have used  for years now I’ve never had a problem. Recently I placed an order of an item by accident, I contacted  most instantly to inform them I don’t need it and asked if I’d be ok to send it straight back. They had put a note on my account! When the parcel came, I didn’t check it and sent it straight back (it was a cleansing item therefore came in a white package so therefore didn’t open it). This went straight back! A few weeks later it was returned to myself. I contacted asos instantly and was told that the warehouse team informed them it was in a ‘heavily used’ condition. I was shocked as I hadn’t even opened the parcel. I provided asos with evidence however was greeted with rude staff and agents. I was told this would be passed onto a higher expert team to de with. Since this time, I have reised the item is faulty therefore have contacted asos on a few occasions trying to inform them of this, I have been ignored, dismissed and rudely passed from pillar to post. I have still had no contact from the ‘expert’ team that was meant to be contacting me, an agent even told me that this didn’t exist so I’m not sure whether asos has told me this to cm me down.\n",

      "After 10+ years as a customer of , ordering clothes on an most weekly basis for most of that time my account was blocked. I was offered no explanation and upon contacting the live chat customer service was told I needed to wait to hear from the “speciist team”. I raise that I had sent off some returns ready that had been marked as delivered but had not yet been refund. They told me that only the “speciist team” could resolve this matter.\n",
      "I so had some items I had yet to return and was told I would need to pay to send these items back myself and would get a refund as long as they were within the 28 day period (which they were). I had to pay nearly £10 to send these items off tracked and made sure to get ‘signed for’ so I could confirm they were delivered. I included a piece of paper detailing each item and order number that were in the return and included my contact details if there were any issues. So now with 2 returns sent and no refund for either I waited patiently to hear from their speciist team.\n",
      "After some time I finly had a response but was still offered not explanation for my account being closed and told only that my account was to remain closed permanently and that I could not reply to the email as it would not be responded to. No mention of either refund so was no closer to a resolution. I once again contacted the live chat as this is the only method of contact for . They once again however informed me I needed to wait for the “speciist team” to review my case even though I mentioned I had ready received this email. I raise again that I had outstanding returns that had not been refunded but was told there was nothing they could do and I would have to wait, so I waited.\n",
      "2 weeks went by, still no refund, still no contact from anyone at asos; I returned to the live chat. After explaining my case for a third time with a different live chat employee I was told that my case had been closed and was given a copy and paste of the email I had ready received some time before. At this point I was extremely frustrated having followed l their instruction and waiting l that time I was still no closer to getting a refund let one an explanation. I asked to speak to a manager or if I could have a contact number to cl to escate this further but was once again told that I would need to wait for the “speciist team” to resolve this matter. After some back and fourth getting nowhere I begrudgingly, once again, agreed to wait.\n",
      "Another week has now past and I’m still no closer to a resolution.  have a significant amount of money that is owed to me in returns that were returned well within the time period. I have provided them with proof of delivery for both and yet they continue to tell me to wait for an email that I feel isn’t coming.\n",
      "This is without a doubt some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced, given the amount of money I have spent with this company over such a long period you would think they would offer some kind of explanation for closing my account. My only hope now is that the items I’ve sent back are refunded as soon as possible so that I may move on and spend that money elsewhere.\n",

I double checked with Robinjerick that it was the right dress as had ordered 3 dresses but in different colours and he confirmed twice he'd refunded the correct item. I so had to email whilst on the chat to Robinjerick images of 1. A khaki dress I ordered was actuly just a jumper I received. It stank of absolute B.O. revolting. 2. The grey crochet dress had three holes in it. 2 at the front and 1 under the armpit and was stretched out of shape. 3. The mustard dress had pulls in it. He checked the images and I asked for a returns label. He emailed one. Packed the 6 items up (returning the others as poor quity and too sml). Thought that was the end of it.

      "I must express my disappointment with . Recently, I've noticed a significant increase in prices just before Black Friday, only to find that they are now offering discounts. This seems quite misleading and raises concerns about the transparency of their pricing practices. It's disheartening to observe that  raised prices before promoting Black Friday ses, making it appear as if customers are getting a great de when, in fact, many se items have seen a noticeable hike in prices. I've been diligently monitoring prices for the past month in anticipation of Black Friday, and it's disconcerting to see the apparent manipulation of prices. This situation leads me to question the integrity of ' ses strategy. Raising prices ahead of a major se event and then claiming to offer discounts can be perceived as deceptive and, in my opinion, borders on fraudulent. As a consumer, I believe it's cruci for companies to maintain transparency and fairness in their pricing practices. It's disappointing to think that some customers may be misled during this supposed shopping bonanza. I sincerely hope that customers become aware of these practices and consider making more informed choices. Such tactics can erode trust, and it's my hope that consumers take a stand against such practices by boycotting companies that engage in them. Please , there's no need for a compelling email denying that this has occurred. Instead, I urge the company to reflect on how ses and pricing are managed. Transparency and honesty should be the cornerstone of any business, especily during significant events like Black Friday.It is my sincere hope that  takes this feedback seriously and considers reevuating its approach to ses and discounts. Consumers should feel confident that they are genuinely benefiting from ses events rather than being misled by inflated prices that are later discounted. Such a shift in approach could go a long way in rebuilding trust with the customer base.In conclusion, I encourage  to prioritize transparency, fairness, and ethic business practices. The long-term success of any company is closely tied to the trust and loyty of its customers, and I believe addressing these concerns will contribute to a more positive and sustainable relationship between  and its clientele.\n",

Their quity service is a joke if they think it's acceptable to sent to their customers used and filthy products most probably worn by some other customer and returned (not even checked properly and pack to be delivered to the next order). This is mot hygienic as you can assume and I won't even bother to return the item, I will  it as I don't want another second with stinky smell in my house. Is not the fist time and won't be the last time they do it. Until now I have returned and report l their faulty orders and nothing changed. From now on I will review them on different websites so at least people know what sort of company this is.\n",

      "I had a size notification for a coat and after months of waiting I got a email to say it was in stock. I went onto asos straight away and ordered. They still use  ( worst delivery company ever ) I was meant to get the delivery Friday but didn’t turn up. It came the Saturday. I had been sent a pair of ladies trousers. I created a return straight away for the qr code went to four different places code wasn’t working. Spoke to someone on live chat and I had to tell them what they needed to do. Got emailed a qr code that didn’t link to my return or notify me it was posted etc. ended up opening a PayP dispute where asos incorrectly told me with a open dispute they couldn’t issue a refund. Provided PayP with pictures proof of postage chat history and I’ve now been refunded.\n",

      "Another time paid for express shipping $30 for a $300 order, figured it was worth it for a larger order.  cancelled the two most expensive items and refused to refund me the difference between regular and express shipping despite the fact I would never have paid $30 to ship a $40 item. Add insult to injury it took over 10 days for item to be delivered, double the quoted time. Finly BEWARE, this company scams you! Here’s how it works for Austrians anyway. You cannot return anything for change of mind because you are advised to return it to them within 28 days of delivery. Now that l sounds fine until you go into the fine print “returns can take 21 BUSINESS days to reach us” notice the odd 1 on that 20! That’s so even if you send the item back the day you received it, the fin number of days including at least 4 weekends that it takes to reach them is a minimum of 29 days! You got it, and they hold you responsible for the time it takes to get to them using THEIR nominated freight carrier and of course they won’t guarantee a delivery date. I will never buy from this company again!\n",

Until after a month of chasing it they told me the warehouse had rejected my return ( didn't recieve an email about this) but they couldn't tell me the reason it had been rejected. After complaining ot the manager said the parcel was being sent back to me. But if I contacted asos when It arrived then they would make me a label so I could return it....Guess what the parcel never cake and 2 weeks later when I chased it up again they told me the return was never rejected and I was given the wrong information. And I finly got my refund.\n",

Great if you want to be disconnected every five minutes and need to reconnect and get a different person every time who you have to then re - explain everything to and still have no explanation or resolution. Will never buy from this dodgy company ever again.\n",

I should not have to reach out to the Customer Service Team every time I return something, to manuly receive my refund. Especily when my return is sitting in your warehouse for 13 days! You expect me to pay you before you dispatch my purchase, so why do I have to wait weeks for you to refund my money?\n",

When I contacted customer service I was told there was a problem with the parcel leaving the warehouse (?) and then I was notified I had a refund with no further information. One star for the rely helpful Customer Services, but I imagine they get a lot of practice.\n",
      "asos is a scam. I checked my size in the data in the size guide, and it is size \"M\", I looked at the model's photo and with a similar height, this hoodie, judging by the shoulders, is too big for model, and it is written that he is wearing size M, I ordered size \"S\", and this size turned out to be too big! I needed size \"XS\" in this case! The difference between size M and XS is big. When I bought clothes from expensive brands, the sizes ways matched perfectly. And these scammers don't admit it. They order cheap clothes from third countries, the sizes don't match and they don't refund postage on returns. The scammers make money from this, they charge £4.50 for  delivery. Whereas on the  website delivery costs £2.45 (0-1kg)! The delivery cost will be even cheaper for businesses. -parrot from support is absolutely useless. Keep in mind that this is a lottery for your money.\n",

Upon getting in touch with the customer service, they didn't give me a reason or didn't address why I'd been blocked and left me by saying they have forwarded the issue to higher ups. Today I get an email from them that they have decided not to accept any further orders from me and left a beautiful line at the end of the email that says exact words\n",

Rely bravo on how bad a company can be.\n",

I was lied to and given poor excuses.  They must think people are backwards.You get a pathetic chat system and cannot speak to anyone anymore.  While the assistant goes off to check your order, the chat system disconnects you for inactivity and you have to go through the whole process again  and waste even more of your time having to explain the whole situation again.I will never use asos again and deleting my account.I buy a lot online from various outlets and not once have I ever received such poor customer service.Finly today I got a refund but what a battle it was to get it and over 7 hours of my time.Totly disgusted and cannot believe asos are getting away with this.

      "Absolutely the worst company when it comes to customer service. I bought a pair of airforces on the 5th of September before cut off time for next day delivery. My flight was in two days and parcel did not arrive on time therefore I requested the parcel to be delivered at a collection point so that DPD would return it after 7 days as stated on their website. I wouldn't be back in time in order to send them back if it had been delivered to my address. Furthermore, I contacted them on the 25th of September telling them that DPD would not collected the parcel and I wanted my refund. The first agent said they would refund or replace if problem was not solved before 3 days. Later on the same day I get an email from a \"speciist whatever\" saying that they opened an investigation and DPD requested 9 days. On the 4th of October they asked for 48h and later sent another email when I chlenged them about my refund that I would need to wait another 9 days. They got back to saying the parcel was lost though I had told them that the parcel was at the shop because I had cled the shop and confirm the parcel was still there. Their response was very much \"copy and paste\". Different email sent by different people. Eventuly they stopped replying at l. They would saying DPD was investigating and to wait for them, I would cl DPD and they would tell me to contact . Literly sending me back and forth. We are in mid November and I am continuously trying to fix the issue myself. So i cled the shop a few days ago making sure the item was there (which apparently was lost) and requested them to collected because it had been sitting there for more than a month. DPD has now collected and delivered the parcel on the 11th and still nothing from  regarding the refund (£109.95) still haven't replied to my email since the time I emailed them on the 1st of November. In addition, I contacted them 2 days ago and was told a speciist would contact me and still nothing. The customer service has gone downhill. I am absolutely disappointed because I have shopped with  for years and unfortunately I just deleted my account not that they would care either. I just won't support a company with awful customer service. Unacceptable way of deing with issues that they created themselves.\n",
      "I would give 0 stars if I could.  customer care agreed to do a late return for me on the 6/11/2023 which I was very appreciative of. I have it as evidence in an email and I was instructed that had to pay the return postage myself which cost £5. Previously before this email I had been told that it could be to discretion of the warehouse but in the last email there was no indication to this. So I was under the impression that  had agreed to do the refund.  I posted the item on the 7/11/2023 and now I have then received an email saying my return was rejected and am now being told it is \"out of date\". I have just been messed about by  getting told one thing from one advisor to another saying that I was told it could have been rejected. If it was clear at any point on the last email that it might have not been accepted I would have not sent it back. Now I’m so being charged for them to return the item back to me.\n",

I requested a replacement and was assured this and a few hours later was given a refund. Queried this again today and was told they have sold out. Only four now available and two of those are nails or necklaces. My daughter is going to be so disappointed. I will never use this company again.\n",

I approached  for clarification but they said they only de with legitimate companies. I am not convinced and asked them to look into the company. Their customer care is awful as there seems no one will look into the problem for me. You can’t speak to anyone senior and they say they will get back to you but don’t.

I then had to send it back again.  I had to spend over 6 hours on 4 different chats before I finly got a refund.   You can not actuly speak to anyone on the phone, everything is done within a chat, where they take ages to respond.  In addition they do not leave notes from previous chat conversations, and you have to repeatedly explain your query everytime to chat to someone new.  Awful customer service, I doubt I will buy again from .\n",

      "Very bad company, I had few problems with them and I decided not to buy anymore stuff from them. They use cheap deliveries which they get lost with no refund, and their gift cards are vid for one year, once they expired you loose the money. This is a proper theft. You feel like you are deeling with air or something very cheap... One star is to much for such scamers.\n",

I paid for  premier, they failed to provide the one thing the service does and my parcel was marked as lost and there policy provides no compensation for customer’s inconvenience and time spent chasing down a human customer service. I was able to get a replacement order but I would like it if compensation came a long with it so that customers can have a good opinion of  and know that if something does go wrong they know they will be okay.

I emailed the same date to ask for a 24 hour extension as the weekend intervened and I have not had a response. It’s now over a week since I emailed to explain and I still have had no response.

You've got my money, but I've not got my goods and clearly won't receive them. , particularly their customer service, have gone so downhill over the years. Avoid at l costs.

I have contacted asos and advised that it is the last item and I still want the item and will somehow find a way to sort it as it’s exactly what I wanted. Been told I have to return it or pay full price. I said I bought it on one of their discounts so even if it ever came back in stock I would have to pay nearly £40 extra. Still wouldn’t help. So now I’m stuck with a coat that’s faulty and paying a lot for and they won’t parti refund just to cover the cost of the trying to fix it. Not impressed. Will be taking further.\n",

      " REVIEW.   ORDER NUMBER 7762We placed an order on 22nd April 2023 for goods worth £32.63p.  Our order never arrived and  suggested this was due to circumstances beyond their control but eventuly offered a refund of 50 percent of the purchase price.  We refused this offer and we’ve instead been offered 90 percent of the purchase price.  However, since our order we have written 39 emails and have been assured on so many occasions that our refund is being processed.  These are automated replies and are therefore meaningless. Customer Services may be very polite but what good is that if they do nothing to reimburse the customer for a refund legitimately owed. However, these promises have proved to be empty gestures and  cannot be either believed or trusted. may not be a scam Company but they are willing to take your money but not to fulfil their obligations.  I would certainly not use this Company again nor would I recommend this Company to anybody else.  I would not touch them again with barge pole!In terms of a review of their service I would give them 0 out of 10!  I will continue to email  until they pay the refund.\n",
      "Ordered a pair of trainers from . They supplied a tracking number which was incorrect. I contacted customer services via live chat to tell them about the issue, they said I had to wait for an update which never happened. Had to contact Customer Service again, who said I would have to wait 12 days before I could get a refund just in case they arrived. On the 12th day I had to contact customer services again for the fourth time to receive my refund. Awful experience.\n",
      "I like that  usuly reacts fast and sorts out things in a good way, but I think something is wrong with their promo codes. How can I receive a promo that \"doesn't work\" in my country? Is it a joke - I spend 2 hours arranging my basket and then find out at checkout that the promo is not working and customer service says it doesn't work in either of the two regions I am able to order from. Smells like cheating- we encourage you to buy using the discount code, but then we tell you it's not working, hoping that you will still place your order.\n",

I just got a response that they won't refund me for this item because I damaged them and they smelled of body odor. I'm honestly insulted. I'm not sure how the others wouldn't wreak of body odor if I tried them l on at the same time. And it's literly not possible that I could have stained them. I tried everything on at the same time, at home. I'm sure someone at the return processing center did this and instead of getting in trouble, blamed me for their mistake.

It's a shame because  has a wide range of a fashion, brands and has nice clothing, but it's hard to shop somewhere if most of the time you don't receive the items or they are delivered late.  I used to buy from  l the time, and had no issues but the last couple years it's been horrendous. (PROBLEM 1- PARCEL WAS  DELIVERED) I've had loads of problems with them in the past. One problem being the delivery driver saying they delivered my items , however, my video recording doorbell that tracks movement says other wise, I was so home l day and didn't have a knock on the door or anything,  they didn't even attempt to delivery it. I told  and they accused me of lying. (PROBLEM 2- TOOK 2 MONTHS TO BE DELIVERED)Second issue , I'm l about giving second chances, so thought I'd try the company again. This time I'd ordered some things for my holiday, I had 9 working days until my holiday and the order type I used was 3-4 working days. My order was never delivered again within the time frame. I messaged them and they said it would come in 2 weeks bear in mind it was ready a month late! Still didn't arrive on this second delivery date they gave, and in  the end asos had to resend the order, but sent me 2 items out of 12 because everything else had sold out! This arrived finly 2 months late. I ended up just returning it l because by that point I didn't want any of it and was fed up. ( PROBLEM 3 - DIDNT COME ND & ACCOUNT AND REFUSED REFUND)- Third issue, I ordered some over a year and a hf  later because they had said they updated their courier etc. So I though oh okay sounds like they are improving! So  I d paid for £6 next day delivery, which firstly didn't come next day, it came 2 days late, I complained about this and after 2 hours and multiple different \" customer service \" advisors through, I managed to somehow get a refund for the delivery! ( usuly  aren't great at accepting their wrong doings and making it right). Anyways every time i did contact their customer service team, they were unhelpful and rude,  I had to contact them around 20 times  to get anywhere. I then got my items and thought that was that. but to my absolute dread I needed to make a return because some of the items were horrendous quity.so I went to do so with 5 days left until my return date expired, and they had locked my account for no reason! I hadn't been told why or anything. I contacted them about it, whilst so notifying them about the return expiry date too, they assured me they would make sure I would be able to return it since the locked account was their fault. They said. They put a note in my account about it. I contacted them again  after leaving it a couple days like they said, the account was unlocked but my return was not being accepted. I contacted them numerous times more about this and they said they will send my issue off to be sorted out by someone of a higher status and send me my return label in a couple days. This never happened, I messaged again asking about it and they said they need me to wait couple more days as I'm in a que. I did this. Couple more days go on again and no email response or label. I message them about this whole problem again, and now they are saying they can't send me the return label because the expiry dates expired. Obviously I knew this that's why I was messaging them!  They  should have known this  too since \" there a supposed note on my account\" and I've spoken to their team 20 odd times prior ready about the issue, whilst constantly being reassured it's being sent. The person who I messaged next , responded saying they can't return the item for me because it's expired, and that's,  that and basicly i should get over it, because the results not changing. She was rude and refused to help. I messaged someone else they said the same thing. But she sent me a return detail list, but stated u need to take this parcel to the post office instead and accept that you will have to  pay the return, and accept that we may refuse the refund when it gets to the warehouse. So in other words pay to send the items back, and then they will refuse to refund me which o know would of happened. So I w lookups have paid for return and lost the items and not got that return.  What's the point in that! Unreliable! Extremely disappointed. Complete scam. What type of  company locks a Customers account after a purchase,and does this  for the entire  period of the return and then unlocks it after the returns expired! All a bit premeditated to me. Absolutely disgusting behaviour. Heartbreaking that they must do this to so many other customers on a daily basis and can get away with it! Im just upset with myself for giving them another chance, I should've known.  I recommend everyone to spend their money else where not on  this sham of a company.\n",

Reaching a live person on chat is a hassle. The first customer service guy who started the chat abandoned it. The second person created a return label to return the incorrect order. Courier has not yet picked up the incorrect order (they cled yday and said they will come today and nothing happened). arently refund will be issued only once they receive the incorrect shipping order though it was no fault of mine that they lost my actu order in transit. Extremely bummed that I did not receive the items I was eagerly waiting for. I commented about this issue on one of the brands instagram posts to get attention from a human and hopefully resolve the issue quicker but they reported my comment as spam when it wasn’t spam. I simply commented what happened and being a soci media manager for a brand myself, it’s sad that  would flag a comment instead of taking it up with customer care and resolving things.

      "Terrible customer service. I ordered some items and paid for the delivery by 12midday option. My notification said to expect delivery between 10.10 and 11.10. When 11.10 came I checked on the order and could see that it had been updated by DPD to say delivery had been made at 10.16 and been received by 'FHF' and a photo that of course could not be loaded. I tried to contact  but there was no-one available so I phoned DPD and they said they would contact their driver and try and get him to come back and sort it. I said I was leaving the house at midday and had been told it needed to be signed for so didn't know how that would work. Luckily I have CCTV and was able to see the driver 'coming back' at just after 1pm and actuly delivering my parcel (no need for a signature apparently!) so my guess he had clearly lied on the tracking to make it look like he's made his targets. He was so fairly quick for someone who had apparently made a drop over an hour and a hf ago and so was presumably on the rest of his round, hmmmm. I get this was DPD's fault but when I explained l this to  they didn't want to know, l they kept repeating parrot fashion was that the tracking said it had been delivered at 10.16 so there was nothing they could do. I offered to share my CCTV evidence, they didn't want to know. As it was, I had to return the whole parcel as it useless arriving later than I needed and so farcicly and legly they should have to refund the postage anyway (at least the standard part) but they continue to fight it and the best they are willing to offer is a promo code. Believe me I won't be shopping with them again. So not only is their customer service awful but they don't know what they legly have to do!!!! Shameful.\n",

    "Shopped with ASOS for years but recently had an issue with them. Bought a dress, was too big so sent it back for an exchange and the item was in stock the whole time. They gave me a full refund instead. I contact them asking why they cannot give me the dress in the smaller size because it is in stock so what’s the issue? Told only thing I can do is reorder the dress even though I got it at something like 20% off for a Black Friday deal and now it’s back up to full price. Told them I’m not doing that as if need to spend ‘X amount’ more on the higher price and another delivery. Was told they’d give me 10% discount. Not good enough as this was still about £5 more (minimum) than what I’d originally paid and requested an exchange for. I get an email which was supposed to contain a 15% off (I managed to talk them up to 15%) promo code but they never included the discount code in the email. I go to Facebook message them and tell them all this and they say they’ll give me free delivery but they don’t reply for days/weeks at a time and still don’t sent me the discount code!!!! They then have the cheek to say they followed all policies and procedures but I have NEVER BEEN SENT THE PROMO CODE and for some reason even though I’ve repeated myself multiple times and sent them a screenshot of the email with no promo code in it the ASOS customer care team are too stupid to actually acknowledge this crucial part to my customer care experience. I’ve ‘talked’ to about 5+ people and not one of them acknowledged my messages about not even having been sent the promo code I was promised. Honestly will never buy from them again.\n",

    "I order from ASOS frequently and usually have nothing bad to say about it - fast delivery, easy returns, great clothes. However, this time I’ve received a faulty item so I got in touch with customer care to get a refund. I heard nothing for weeks so got in touch again. Still nothing. My coat was now falling to bits so I got in touch via the live chat, hoping to get a refund as the coat was now out of stock. The person I was speaking to was clearly reading from a script and was not amenable, asking i send back the coat so they could inspect it. I explained I was unable to do this as I don’t have another coat, so I sent pictures of the faults. I was still told that I would need to send the coat back for inspection (it’s 31st December and very cold...!) I suggested I would need to get the coat repaired and this would incur a cost. ASOS reluctantly agreed to help cover the costs of this, provided I do this myself and send a receipt. What a joke. I’ve already waited weeks with no response to get this quit frankly poor and unhelpful result, with no other compensation for the other time and resource this has incurred on me. To say this is shocking customer service is an understatement, for such a huge organisation and the price I paid for the coat, I would have expected a lot more . Very, very disappointed.\n",

    "ASOS were very prompt in sorting out the troubles I had experienced with their parcel delivery service. There was a no quibble replacement made. Excellent service!\n",
    "The site is good. The customer service is amazing. But changing to Hermes was the biggest mistake they ever did. I’ve never had so many complications or mistakes made in a delivery.\n",
    "Had a problem with parcel being delivered to wrong address which was no fault of ASOS. Spoke to Alex on live chat and the order got re-issued. Great customer service.\n",
    "I love their new trendy social media posts !\n",
    "My parcels are regularly not delivered next day despite paying for next day delivery. The customer service team send a generic email saying sorry. Asos you need to stop using Hermes, they do not deliver on time, they are usually take 2 days and miss the time slot they say it will be delivered in. Please switch back to DPD.\n",
    "They lost my order before newyear eve.. they say i swear but i didnt.. i just want them to ship me again the prdoucts with fast shipping on they bill.. but one product was out of stock so they cant ship the rest??? The costumer service lady was really not nice. Asos have a really bad costumer service...\n",
    "May was helpful. She did not explain why the dress I received was different from what was advertised but she provided the information to return the dress and answered my questions thoroughly.\n",
    "Chelsea was very helpful! There was a delay with the courier, which I understand is nothing that Customer Service can really do much about. Service was pleasant and very efficient.\n",
    "Horrid they did not deliver my item after over a month and they offered a silly coupon of £4.80 on an order that would cost over £25 to replace\n",
    "My package wasn’t delivered by Hermes even though it said I had signed for it when I wasn’t even in! But ASOS customer service were really helpful and are sending me a replacement. Really happy with the service.\n",
    "Reliable, consistent and user friendly. I've ordered from ASOS repeatedly over the last 10 years, and the very few issues have been dealt with efficiently and satisfactorily.\n",
    "Although an outcome was not realised, the assistant was very helpful and knowledgeable. My circumstances were exceptional and I was at least given helpful links to continue the resolution of my issue.\n",
    "this is my first and last time shopping with asos. i ordered a dress on the 28th of november and it was said to arrive by the 20th of december. it was now the 30th and no information is being provided to me by customer service as to where my package is. they expect me to wait till the 21st of january to get a refund. i no longer have use for the dress. Also the fact that the tracking that is giving is only for “asos shipping reference” (terms used by asos customer service employee) is ridiculous. i have no intention of paying for return shipping. i have never been so frustrated by lack of answers by several customer service representatives.\n",
    "Love all the items. Great quality and prices and even better customer service chatting with the representative. Im new to the UK but so glad I found out about ASOS!\n",
    "If I could give customer service no stars I would!!!! I was waiting for 2 hours for someone to reply to my problem and once they did they did absolutely bugger all!! Not okay!!!\n",
    "NIce! I know what to do now~\n",
    "Job well done\n",
    "I had an issue with my delivery and they resolved it straight away for me. The customer service advisor was brilliant and promptly sorted my order for me\n",
    "Incredibly frustrated with Hermes delivery... you need to stop using them!\n",
    "My parcel wasn’t at the place ‘in the picture’\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks the the ASOS team for solving the issue.\n",
    "Claude answered very fast and answered my question in a perfect manner. Thank you and all the best for 2020 :-)\n",
    "Excellent, fast customer service during the busiest period of the year - very impressed and much appreciated! Lovely customer service too which is the added bonus. Very understanding in regards to returns without labels, again much appreciated during this busy period. Thank you, Asos.\n",
    "I had an order that was never dispatched. However I got in touch with their online chat team and spoke to someone name Abbel, who was lovely and helpful - within 10minutes I was offered a refund or the order to be sent with a sped up delivery time and should be receiving this within 72 hours.\n",
    "Asos- Superb place to buy from. Hermes- worst ever courier service. Shopping on Asos is very easy but needed your product to get to you, may be hard. Hermes told me they’ll between 1-3. Didn’t come until 19:41. I was at home at the time but wasn’t given the parcel at all. Door didn’t ring, neighbour didn’t receive it. They handed it to someone they thought lived at the address and enjoyed their evening. Write specific delivery notes when buying!\n",
    "Callum was very helpful today and solved my query\n",
    "Excellent. Issue resolved very quickly. Thank you.\n",
    "I ordered a pair of shoes from  this damn website for the first time.It was the first time i did not  check the reviews of the people  they used it and literally i gave them a gift of 55 euros for a pair of shoes which apparently is never going to be delivered and no refund is going to be made.This website  is a FRAUD.PAY ATTENTION-FRAUD WEBSITE-ASOS NEDERLANDS\n",
    "Hannah is really efficient & helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was in quite a confused situation and Hannah did help me to find a right and very quick way. Totally solved my problems.\n",
    "although the delivered item was faulty, the customer care provided was excellent. well done for the service provided.\n",
    "I had an item I presumed had been stolen from my order as the item was missing and the package had been sealed back up. I was very upset and stressed about this and trying to sort it. I contacted ASOS customer service via Facebook messenger with details and photos explaining what had happened. The customer service advisors were very understanding and the issue was sorted out as soon as possible sending me  out a replacement. Very appreciative.\n",
    "I have used ASOS religiously for about 8 years but have had the misfortune of crossing their customer service team one too many times in the last few months. I have encountered various issues with the orders I've placed over the past year, from damaged hair wax leaking all over other items, to jeans appearing completely different to how they look online and next day delivery orders not being honoured.\n",
    "\n",
    "On each occasion, they seem incapable of viewing the circumstance from the customer's perspective. The most recent example - that of the hair wax - is the one which tipped me over the edge. Despite two other items being damaged, they have refused to refund them as it was \"only the wax which was faulty\". All customer queries go through the ridiculous 'Gnatta' online chat system, meaning you cannot have a proper conversation with anybody. There is no telephone number or written address available, and if you ask to escalate a complaint or speak to a supervisor you will be told \"all complaints are reviewed and dealt with alternatively\". It is all designed to protect the company rather than help the customer, and to deflect and ignore complaints as much as they possibly can.\n",
    "\n",
    "The products and prices are good but if you ever have a problem with an order (which for me have become increasingly frequent) then you'll never want to shop there again.\n",
    "They apologised for delayed delivery which wasn’t their fault and were very helpful. I couldn’t fault them.\n",
    "I contacted asos today regarding a parcel hermes have lost. Naeem was helpful and polite.  Good customer service all round.\n",
    "naeem was the person i spoke to about my order. He was very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "My only issue is that asos sometimes delivers through hermes. Hermes delivered to another address allowing them to sign as 'mumma', name taken down as 'J', and with no slip or any indication that the order was delivered to another address. On an order worth over £200 this is just not acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But ASOS has resent the order, so i have no issue with them.\n",
    "Almost instant response. Could not have done anything better. Thank you both Zahid and Freddie\n",
    "The products on the website are good, but the courier company （Hermes) is too rubbish. I hope your company can change a courier company to cooperate, otherwise it will affect your business.\n",
    "Customer service, responds on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delivery is quite fast (to Nigeria) compared to Aliexpress. Orders within a month, and I recieved within that same month window period.\n",
    "Mark was efficient and able to answer all queries quickly!\n",
    "This is the first time I've had a problem with an order although it taken a couple of days to sort I happy with the outcome. This might change if I do not receive what I have ordered.\n",
    "Love ASOS love products/ fast shipping , great customer service, easy returns  choices of payment so yes ASOS is my favourite\n",
    "I ordered my package twice and did not receive it. I got in contact with customer service after several days, when they finally responded, the customer service guy just left the chat before I even was done. I find this so unacceptable... the worst customer care I have experienced.\n",
    "And I still have not received my dress and ASOS won’t help me. I used to love asos,but if this is how they handle Christmas time and their customers, I have to say, I am very disappointed\n",
    "Was so disappointed,  because my order should have been delivered on the 23rd as promised.  I never got it. Just enquired today the 30th. Was told it didn't leave thier wharehouse. Only one with nothing to open for Xmas☺️\n",
    "I used to really love ASOS customer service but over the last 1 and a half the service has gone down. They just apologise without giving any solutions or compensation and give timescales. I paid for premier delivery which is £14.99 a year for unlimited next day. I’ve had occasions when the items don’t come next day, I once waited 14 days for an order and then they sent it back to the warehouse in the end (I didn’t ask them to do that). I currently have an order that was due on the 27th in December and they’re telling me it may or may not come on the 3rd and if it doesn’t to contact them. When things like this happen repeatedly customers should have delivery charge refunded straight away. By the time my order comes I won’t even need it for my event. I don’t mind waiting 5-7 working days if Its standard delivery but if I pay for a service and it’s not fulfilled I should get my money back but ASOS customer service think differently. I’m not one to leave bad reviews but I dread contacting ASOS customer service these days because I know exactly what I’m going to get “sorry, wait however long and if it’s not arrived contact us again...” I’m a regular customer and it’s disappointing to see a company you love not treat you as a valued customer.\n",
    "Amazing service and lots of desire to help\n",
    "What is the point of paying for next day delivery if Items don't turn up and go missing. Terrible customer service.\n",
    "ASOS customer care and service is ALWAYS first class 👌🏻\n",
    "Chelsea was very helpful and proactive in her approach\n",
    "Very friendly and helpful with everything\n",
    "Paying for a next day delivery order and being told two days later that there is a chance it would arrive today? Brilliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer advisor I spoke to was not apologetic one bit.\n",
    "I explained to them that I had ordered it Saturday in time for Tuesday as I needed to use it then. Did he apologise and listen to my complaints?... NO.\n",
    "\n",
    "He kept trying to redirect me to the Hermes website to contact them, not that the fact that I told them i've been trying to contact Hermes prior to contacting them mattered at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useless and disregarding to loyal customers. I still don't get why Hermes are a legitimate company who claim they are one of the leading delivery services, ridiculous.\n",
    "Friendly and helpful. I had to wait quite a while, hence the reason I didn’t give 5 stars. But it was just after Christmas hence understandable. I would’ve given 4.5 stars if possible.\n",
    "Very helpful  customer service department. Can't fault them.\n",
    "My issue was sorted within 30 minutes on the live chat option. My parcel wasn’t received by Hermes with a few problems with the process given. A refund was issued after the relevant checks. Couldn’t have asked for more.\n",
    "Had a mix up with my orders and contacted customer care through chat. I had a chat with Lauren who was very helpful in clarifying my orders. Overall, I am very happy with the service.\n",
    "Good Customer Service and resolved the issue quickly! Thanks Lauren\n",
    "Aaron was very efficient and helpful with my issue and has put my mind at ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks Aaron:)\n",
    "Missing an item in post, but customer service was extremely quick at sorting the issue!\n",
    "Karis was very prompt and helpful with her assistance today. Thanks very much!\n",
    "Never received my package. Now when I talked to the customer service for the second time they said they can't send me my package. This is a joke! Never ordering from this site again!\n",
    "Do ASOS CARE? Very disappointed, I have used ASOS before and they were fine. The goods were great and delivery as expected. However, this time has been a nightmare and from my experience, I don't think ASOS care one bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be fair, I think the issue was with Hermes the delivery firm. I ordered on 14/12 and order was expected 19/12.\n",
    "\n",
    "I appreciate it's near to Christmas and everyone will be busy, however, having to use chat & twitter for updates wasn't ideal and I'm told that if it doesn't come by today 30/12 then at least I can get a refund or a replacement 🤔🤔🤔.\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess it teaches me a valuable lesson, don't buy Christmas presents via ASOS and don't expect them to care if anything goes wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess I can go and buy a late Christmas present from a bricks and mortar store now and hopefully at a discount in the sales...hey ho, every cloud #ASOS #HERMES\n",
    "\n",
    "** UPDATE**\n",
    "Goods didn't arrive and refund was not issued from ASOS. Fortunately, I paid via credit card and they have refunded my payment as part of the claim service protection they offer\n",
    "They left me without my Crissthmas pressent. And did not give me any other option to get my purchase in time.\n",
    "The response was prompt, the examination was in-depth and the pleasant and respectful discourse helped me greatly\n",
    "Lovely service! We could not do what I wanted but the way she looked into it and helped me was great!\n",
    "Great service from asos. Had an issue with a refund which was sorted efficiently using the online chat option.\n",
    "Great customer service from a girl name Ella .\n",
    "Andreera was really helpful and answered all my questions as best as she could.\n",
    "the person i talked to was nice and dealt with my issue well\n",
    "The lady was very helpful with my request\n",
    "Although it sometimes takes a while to get a response, I always got the help I needed! Thank you!!\n",
    "Abbas was helping me about an after sale issue. She is really helpful! Glad Asos has such good employees.\n",
    "I recently ordered an item from Asos and was upsold next day delivery for £9.95. Asos stated that there could be delays on standard delivery and hence the next day delivery service looked like the best option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hermes who are Asos chosen delivery company failed to delivery, and now I have zero idea as to whether the item will be delivered or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asos deliberately upsold this delivery service. If a company can not cope with high demand for delivery or customer service then they shouldn't offer a service and should definitely not be willing to take a customers hard earned money for something they can not guarantee.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have requested to cancel my order and hope that asos give full refund.\n",
    "Dani did a good job explaining to me the issue and helping me. She was very nice and kind during the whole exchange!\n",
    "Callum was super friendly, quick and helpful.\n",
    "Pathetic response basically no solution we are busy.....:26th Dec within NZ will be delivered on 9th Jan. What a turn around time...\n",
    "So fare so good i got replys straight away when ever i had a question, an they also cover inport shipping fees to aus wich is great, an if they dont reply asap remember they have to reply to thousands of people patients is key. Will post another review once i get my order but so fare 5 stars thanks asos looking forward to more business with use.\n",
    "My son’s ASOS gift card had been lost and Customer Rep., Jae, was very polite and eager to help. Than you!!\n",
    "Thomas from customer service is incredible. Helpful and kind. You lucky that u have him in your company.\n",
    "Explained all the issues I had been experiencing and have sent them on to be fixed! Jordon was lovely!\n",
    "If I could leave zero stars I would. I have experienced the worse end to end customer service from ASOS and their delivery partner Hermes ever. It is now 18 days since my order was placed for my daughters Christmas presents and all I am receiving are continuous expected delivery dates from Hermes and ASOS. ASOS have even told me separately that my parcel has been delivered and are now telling me to wait another 10 days. I have asked and asked for contact information to escalate and have been continuously ignored. Absolutely disgraceful service and ASOS have had my money for 16 days. The last email even asked me to leave a review with an embarrassed face emoji icon.\n",
    "We ordered some boxer shorts for our son and were told that, if we we ordered by 19 Dec, they would arrive before Christmas.  Well, here we are on 29 December and, guess what, no boxers.  What a useless pile of garbage Asos are (Asos is A Shower of *hit!).  Ten days, and counting, to deliver some undies.  Never again!  Never!!  Ever!!!\n",
    "Do not order from ASOS whilst they use Hermes! Paid for next day delivery for NYE to be told I should expect to wait a week for delivery before asos will act - despite asos advertising delivery in time for NYE! Their attempt at customer service is p*** poor. Time will tell whether I will actually even receive my parcel.\n",
    "Awful service! Honestly I am very surprised that a company like ASOS doesnt have a complaints department or procedure!\n",
    "\n",
    "I was given an online gift voucher and i bought a few items.. all good! Unfortunately a few items were not for me and I returned them within the timeframe. However my gift voucher was not returned with the refund!! As I can't find the booking reference and they will not refund the card!!! They won't search my name, account number or post code!!! Just keep asking for a reference number and have said they can't help until I find one.... If I had one why would i NOT give it to them!!!\n",
    "I would expect this problem for a small company but NEVER ASOS!! Be very aware about buying friends or family gift/ e ticket vouchers!\n",
    "Samantha was very helpful and has requested a replacement item be sent to me. I love ASOS but I hope that they choose a different courier service in future as this is not the first time Hermes has lost my item. Increasingly becoming in favour of shopping in person rather than online.\n",
    "Very friendly and helpful service via the Live Chat. Quickly resolved my problem.\n",
    "I’m very disappointed!\n",
    "I ordered a pair of boots on december 13 and it’s december 29 today and they haven’t arrived yet while estimated delivery was on december 27.\n",
    "Really,shame on you!\n",
    "I truly regreted trusting Asos!\n",
    "It takes days for the order to arrive in Italy like is is the end of the world!\n",
    "very fast and quick solution to my problem\n",
    "Laura was super quick to reply and really helpful, she gave me all the info I needed. Would definitely use this service again.\n",
    "Very quick and easy through their webchat and happy to help, they sorted my query out within less than 5 minutes.\n",
    "I had a very poor recent experience the week before Christmas resulting in me needing to try replace whole order. Poor customer care and communication.\n",
    "Placed order\n",
    "Received email to state order dispatched\n",

    "I didn’t receive my order and it’s like pulling teeth to get this resolved\n",
    "Great customer service experience\n",
    "Excellent job to the advisor that helped me today\n",
    "Products in 90% really decent and easy to use app\n",
    "But if some goes wrong with an order customer service really poor and no option to talk to someone on the phone is a real problem .. comparing to next , eBay where this option is available\n",
    "Very good!!!!\n",
    "Oliver was really helpful and helped me with my enquiry quickly\n",
    "so i send a package with 4 items, i get credit for 2 items only and Poppie is saying to show her proof of postage. i did not take a pick of your label since i have premier.  so i paid for the 2 items, returned them and you def got them because you credited me for the $131 dress and the $57 shirt but ZERO for the other 2 items.  Before she rudly ended our chat, her last words were please send me the proof of postage and i will look into it for you EVEN tho i already told her i did not nor never take pics of the return label.  Very horrible customer service.  Make me wonder how many times i sent things back and never got refunded for them by Asos!????\n",
    "I am extremely happy with the quality of the shoes I purchased.  Also the customer service representatives went beyond my expectations to help me find exactly what I was looking for!\n",
    "Oliver was helpful and sorted my problem quickly. The problem wasn’t fully rectified, I didn’t get the exchange I wanted, and my question about the problem with the order wasn’t answered, but a refund was authorised so I was happy with that.\n",
    "Package was never received and no refund was given when guaranteed delivery was a week ago. Still no sign of package. FedEx issued a claim and told me it was lost and ASOS did not issue me a refund.\n",
    "I really love their products. Delivery was quick, product was great\n",
    "No update on delayed delivery and pointless responses from customer care when stating how late my order was and that it completely missed it on or before delivery date by an additional 7 days. Not impressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love the clothes on the website but delivery and updates were a joke.\n",
    "Chloe Paige was sooo helpful with me with assistances for a return of something I ordered for my bf for Christmas that was too small.\n",
    "Lewis helped me and answered all my question very quickly\n",
    ":)\n",
    "An item has been lost in transit over Xmas but ASOS have responded very quickly and kept me advised whilst they were looking into it. Annoying that it is lost but excellent service in the situation.\n",
    "I went on live chat regarding a delayed refund and the lady was very helpful and managed to sort out the issue in minutes. Quick and easy!\n",
    "Not happy at all, ASOS clearly are interrogating customer with stupid question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered a coat was not at home, parcel was signed for by me with a scribble, then got a slip from Hermes(worst ever courier company in existence) stating the item was left inside the bin, clearly I didn’t advise ASOS or Hermes to do this.\n",
    "Got an email from ASOS today asking me to confirm I’ve not received anything, when clearly they got the proof, the s##t has hit the fan\n",
    "Sadly 3x orders got messed up but Jaeden was super helpful!\n",
    "Very helpful live chat associate. Made sure I got the resolution that I needed!\n",
    "Customer care at ASOS is prompt to respond to issues & very quick to find a resolution.\n",
    "The agent Erim was Very prompt and provided  friendly service. She will look into my order and contact me within 72 hours. I was not credited all the items that I returned. Hopefully this issue will be resolved quickly within the 72 hours.  This was my first experience ordering from ASOS and have been very pleased thus far.\n",
    "Very helpful and quick responses! Thank you Daisy\n",
    "Customer service pretty fast. Should update the app more often on the products that are out of stock so that when we pay for the item it doesnt take so much time to tell you that you will be refunded for the item that was out of stock and for the customer to wait for 2 months! Thats pathetic.\n",
    "I hope that someone take this review into consideration.\n",
    "I bought three items for black Friday, never arrived. I contacted customer service over and over again but they only respond to a message after which you have to do it all over again, or they don't answer directly. They asked me to wait ten days longer than the order date and after this nefound and not replacement. Yesterday I ordered from the app of a friend a dress that they don't have in stock but it was still on the site, obviously the dress has not arrived and not even the refound. I put a star because it is not possible to put less. Shame on you.\n",
    "I love Asos shopping, the experience is always so easy! Beth was great at helping me with my returns question, fast and efficient!\n",
    "Customer service was really helpful in understanding and resolving the problem of not receiving my requested exchange, despite the overall incident's annoyance. I believe using another courier could avoid such problems. I've had problems with Hermes half the times I've used it\n",
    "I think Asos need to change their delivery courier\n",
    "Great clothes and very helpful customer service. Only drawback is they use Hermes for deliveries, which service is terrible at least in my area.\n",
    "Very good service. Helped me with my problem straight away within 5 minutes. Trustable asos with the most beautiful clothing and footwear. :)\n",
    "I purchased gift vouchers online for a future dated birthday gift via email but unfortunately gave an email address no longer in use, 5 mins on the service chat and I was advised this had been passed to a service team to redirect them to an alternative email address. 2 hours later the vouchers were served to the recipient.\n",
    "I've been a customer for years and their service was great. Things have gone down hill and fast. I ordered items on Black Friday and then returned some of the items, and am still waiting for a refund. After contacting customer services (which is a nightmare in its self) I'm non the wiser what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the items is faulty and I'm dreading the process of returning it, so much so that I may just repair it myself to save the hassle!\n",
    "\n",
    "Shame that a company which was once so good seems to be going down the pan.\n",
    "Terrible. I ordered coat and they send me totally damaged item. I bought it at a discount on black friday and when I wanted to change the coat, it is not possible, but I can return the coat back and order again. No discounts, of course. So they send the destroyed item and I can order it again at a more expensive price. Great.\n",
    "Customer service terrible - I deal with it for more than two weeks without a result.\n",
    "Terrible customer service. Terrible delivery service. Terrible at dealing with complaints.\n",
    "Managers nevwr in the office when asked for.\n",
    "Literally I've called Mon to Fri and there was no manager I could talk to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "O/5 star\n",
    "Online chat is useful, although I was waiting for over 12 minutes before I was connected. I wanted to exchange an item, but there is no info online as to how to do this, which is a little frustrating - so you have to get in touch.\n",
    "The staff Ben helping me out is very fast and efficient in acknowledging my problem. All sorted out in less than 5 mins..\n",
    "Love using ASOS chat. Often have trouble with orders/ delivery/ vouchers and codes on the ASOS website so it’s helpful to have people who know what they are talking about and actually help you fix your problems. Talked to Sarah today, she was very helpful. I had Issues with vouchers I had received as gifts for Christmas but all fixed now thanks to ASOS chat. ASOS chat is very good because I like talking to real people, it’s more instant that emails which I love.\n",
    "I made the order. Didn't received it. The ASOS team said that they made the refund. HALF A YEAR AFTER -NO REFUND!!!!! Tried to figure out what the problem,  but they again and again wrote me the same - we made the refund, it should come to you in 10 days. Half a year it didn't come. Send them the screenshot of my bank account. Nothing...\n",
    "Very polite and nice and also replies on time\n",
    "One of my best places to shop and great customer service always make me hsppy\n",
    "Bought a jacket during Black Friday. The delivery is over a week late and they told me to wait for another month. Just terrible customer service. Avoid it.\n",
    "My problem was resolved, maybe should be in a less time, but it is ok, the most important is that you gave me a solution\n",
    "Not really helpful. I had a problem with my delivery and the agent told me to sort things out by myself with the delivery which is not my job.\n",
    "Very helpful and kind! Thank you Thomas\n",
    "If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have given ASOS a 5/5 but recently I had a lot of issues with customer service and returns. My family and I were going on vacation and I ordered swimsuits for my brother and father and then sunglasses and accessories for myself. I got express shipping which said it would be delivered in two business days (I was ordering on a Wednesday morning and it estimated Friday as the delivery – we were leaving for our trip on Saturday).\n",
    "\n",
    "I placed the order but when I got the confirmation, it had Monday as the delivery date. I spent over 30 minutes chatting with customer service and they said there was nothing I could do as that was the fastest shipping speed. They would not let me cancel the order since you only get 15 minutes to cancel yet they had me chatting in the customer service chatroom for 30+ minutes and only told me this at the end of our conversation. They then told me I could just return the whole package, which I agreed to. I then went back online and re-ordered EVERYTHING and got one-day shipping (the most expensive option). Come Friday, I get BOTH the one-day and the express orders, so I ordered double for no reason and the customer service lied when they said Monday was the soonest they could ship these items. It was very disappointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that all being said, the quality of ASOS products is usually amazing (their size chart is a bit off though, so make sure to carefully read the sizing for each item). Their return policy is also very nice and the fact it is free is great too. I regularly use ASOS and I really like their clothing, size range, and accessories, but they need better customer service and more effective communication.\n",
    "Did not give me price adjustment and just said it cannot be done, This is ridiculous, I just purchased 9 items and they went on sale. I am never purchasing from ASOS ever again, very disappointed!\n",
    "Thomas was awesome! He created a return label that I was struggling with for a week and had called customer care earlier about.\n",
    "Was charged for shipping when I spent more than the required amount for free shipping, received the wrong size for an item just wanted to exchange it for the same thing but the size I actually ordered and was given a hard time about something that was the company’s error took me a literal hour for a partial resolution  and now I’m waiting for an email that I may never get not shopping on this website again, customer service is non existent\n",
    "Misleading Delivery Timeline On Standard Delivery:\n",
    "1. Placed an order on Nov 10th. Estimated Delivery Dec 2nd, received on Dec 24th\n",
    "2. Placed another other for a red dress to wear for a christmas event on Nov 25th. Estimated delivery date, Dec 15th. I'm yet to receive this order and christmas is over.\n",
    "I usually don't have issues when I go with Express Delivery. Not impressed with my recent delivery experience.\n",
    "Order arrived sooner than expected. Correct information. Great shopping experience.\n",
    "Ordered a 3 piece suit from Asos in the Christmas sales. Several days later I received an email to say the trousers and waistcoat are now out of stock however they have other items on their website. Not much good when they won't match the suit jacket I bought... Will have to waste my time sending the jacket back once it eventually arrives.\n",
    "Do yourself a favour and buy elsewhere.\n",
    "out of the three people I talked to in the past, Abbas has been incredible and finally able to get me a refund! gave me so many information and helped me very much\n",
    "Fast delivery. 14hrs from ordering to being delivered. Customer service from Thomas on querying a return was second to none.\n",
    "Out of the 4 delivery options that were given to me at the checkout for ASOS I chose next day delivery which cost €12 as I was led to believe by reviews and friends that their service was reliable. I needed a new dress for a wedding which is why I paid extra for their service. My parcel was due to be delivered on the 27th of December and it is now the 28th of December and there is no sign of my parcel. Their customer care has now told me that my parcel could either be delivered on the 30th of December or the 2nd January. This is so disappointing as my wedding is on the 30th of December, so any parcel delivered would be useless to me. I’m so disappointed that a service which was so highly recommended has let me down and want to warn others about their late delivery, even if you paid extra.\n",
    "Oliver help out with my missing order. He has sorted this for me by arranging a replacement order. 👌🏻\n",

    "Was assisted by Oliver - he was of great help and rectified the problem swiftly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks Oliver!\n",
    "Very good service, fast and comftebol\n",
    "Absolutely no explanation for why my parcel didn't turn up 3 times in a row. Ordered over a month ago for next day delivery that never arrived. Requested replacements that still never arrived. In the end I had to request a refund but before doing so I tried to communicate using Facebook chat as promoted on the website but didn't even get the courtesy of a response. The customer service team on the Gnatta chat facility aren't particularly sympathetic either. Really poor.\n",
    "I bought my husband a hollister jumper for xmas, from ASOS a site that I use very frequently. Unfortunately the jumper had 2 holes in the middle of it, above the pockets and were very noticeable. I got in touch with ASOS and advised them if this, and their response was to send the package back to them for a refund. This mistake was no fault of mine and is now a big inconvenience for me to have to package and return the item to get my money back.\n",
    "Terrible customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "You guys sent me the wrong size during the Black Friday sale, which i patiently sent back and re-ordered, then you's wouldn't even honor the discount for the second pair even though it was ASOS fault.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Service was terrible, hardly any reply. I am a customer care agent myself and we ensure we respond promptly to our customers. Only good thing about this experience was the delivery was actually quick, even though it was the wrong size you's sent, it still came quick.\n",
    "I love Asos it’s simple and convenient. I spoke to an advisor Florence she resolved my query straight away really happy. Thank you\n",
    "Horrible. Ordered on Dec 15 and “despatched” on 16th with estimated delivery shortly after. Package still in transit. Will never use again and trying to connect with them or UPS is a maze of hell\n",
    "I placed an order on the 7th December for some presents for Christmas. I received an email on the 17th to inform me that my order had been dispatched and I could track it using the Yodel Link provided. It got up until Christmas Eve and I still had not received my delivery. After trying all day I finally got through to someone on the live chat who said there had been issues with the courier and he would reorder my items and I would receive an email with an update within 48 hours. Panicked that the presents were now not coming, I had to go out Christmas Eve and buy replacement presents.\n",
    "I then received an email on Boxing Day stating that not all of my order could not be fulfilled.\n",
    "I phoned ASOS to find out what was going on, only to be told my parcel had never been dispatched as it ‘is a very busy time of year’. I couldn’t believe what I was being told and requested a manager called me back the following day to explain what on earth was going on, seeing as they had taken my money on the 7th and never even dispatched my package!!!!\n",
    "Surprise surprise no call back from ASOS.\n",
    "Then on Saturday 28th I received a call from a supervisor claiming that the parcel had in-fact left the warehouse but somehow it had disappeared! Unbelievable.\n",
    "I will never be using ASOS again.\n",
    "Advisor was very helpful and got the info I needed\n",
    "Have always found Asos to be quick and efficient with high quality products. Only thing that let it down this time was the massively delayed next day delivery over the Christmas period. I feel though this has more to do with Hermes than Asos itself. However, the live chat feature they have is a great way of sorting issues quickly and the reps are always happy to help.\n",
    "5 star amazing service by the customer care team. After the Christmas \"Crazies\" on Christmas Eve, I jumped on to purchase a gift card and I completely botched the recipiants email address. To my horror Christmas lunchtime I discovered my mistake when my nephew announced he had not received his gift card email.\n",
    "I jumped on immediately to the customer care area - not expecting much at all being Christmas Day - followed by the Boxing Day mayhem (which with such an amazing sale I wanted my nephew to be able to participate in).\n",
    "Within 24 hours and the biggest craziest time of the year, the problem that \"I created\" was fixed by customer service and my nephew was happily shopping the Boxing Day sales.\n",
    "The communication by the customer care team was outstanding each step of the resolution. The friendliness, professionalism and prompt replies was such a pleasant experience and surprise.\n",
    "Thank you ASOS for being outstanding and going over and beyond to fix this for me so quickly. We were back shopping in no time and will not hesitate to continue to come back and also let everyone know loud and clear what an amazing company to deal with you all are.\n",
    "Thank you for helping make our Christmas Merry.\n",
    "T xx\n",
    "I really happy with customer care I had chat with rubbaca  and she was very helpful\n",
    "Absolutely love asos customer service! Have seen some conflicting reports on the socials but I have NEVER had an issue in response time or quality of response, I find the team really friendly, helpful & prompt to respond, well done team :))\n",
    "I am not sure that has happened to the company , but their customer service sucks. I placed the order on nov 27, it’s dec 29 and still hasn’t arrived . Asked for the refund , was told to wait another ... month lol till Jan 27. I needed it for Christmas . Don’t need it anymore . Moreover , one of the items went on sale, I asked for price adjustment , since I didn’t even get it yet . Was told to send it back ( what to send ? Don’t have it ) and buy a new one that’s went on sale . So, the customer service rep is wasting the company’s money for return shipping instead of just doing an adjustment .\n",
    "Received incorrect size to what I’d ordered and ASOS were unable to exchange until I’d waited for the other to be returned. The item went out of stock. Disappointing.\n",

    "Poor customer service. I had paid for Premier delivery (next day delivery for the year) and my parcel arrived after 2 days. No apology, no explanation even when I had contacted them. They could not provide a refund for the delivery or any form of compensation and just stated that delays can happen. Absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT PAY FOR PREMIER NEXT DAY DELIVERY AS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY.\n",
    "Awful really awful\n",
    "\n",
    "I ordered 2 weeks before Xmas and was told the items would be delivered around the 17th December!! It is the 28th now and still nothing received! The app states that my items were delivered on the 16th. I’ve spoken to ASOS in the live chat who day that this is an error and the items are not delivered. I asked for a refund and was told I have to wait till the 1st jan before this could be processed why??? Also I asked to make a complaint and the person I was speaking to just flatly told me they didn’t have a complaints process and he will just acknowledge what I say!! This is ridiculous i used to really like ASOS and never had a problem but this is the worst customer service I have ever seen!!\n",
    "Shocking ordered goods which where meant for Christmas. They still haven't arrived and no one can tell me why. Trying to get a refund but actually getting someone to respond to email direct messages or phone calls is pointless. Not one person will take any responsibility or ownership. Will never use again\n",
    "I had THE worst experience with ASOS this last order.\n",
    "My order never showed up and I couldn’t get a hold of anyone to help make it right FOE A MONTH.\n",
    "$144 is a lot of money to spent on winter essentials to not even have them. I chose ASOS on Black Friday over other stores and I wish I would have chosen another place to give my business so I could have the items in a timely manner.\n",
    "People took DAYS to respond to my emails (which is THE only way to communicate with them apparently).\n",
    "After a month of trying to get my items they finally gave me my money back. Thank goodness because that was the ONLY close to good thing to come out of this. So basically, my money was basically held hostage for a month and I got nothing to show for it. They didn’t even offer me a discount code or anything.\n",
    "I had a problem with hermes not being able to find my address, so I chatted to someone on the live chat and they were super helpful in confirming my address and promising to refund the next day delivery i paid for, had to go on the chat the next day to get this done and another lovely helpful person helped me do this, so amazing customer care!\n",
    "Live chat was simple.  Dealt with my enquiries.\n",
    "The representative was very helpful and kind. She gave me the best service I could ask for and answered all of my questions.\n",
    "Very long waiting times & responses are extremely slow, otherwise the agent is very effective in dealing with enquiries\n",
    "I enjoy shopping from ASOS. There’s good prices and usually I have no problems. However, recently I ordered an item and payed £5.95 for next day delivery. The item arrived today and when I opened it I realised that it was completely different to what I ordered. As I payed for next day delivery you can see my frustration with this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to speak to customer care to see what could be done about this and I spoke to an assistant called NIMAT. I explained the situation and was told that I needed to return the item and a refund would be given to me. I then asked how long this would take and was told 7 days and I would receive the refund after it has been spent back. Then I told them how much it was including shipping. However, I was then informed that I would not receive a refund for the delivery my order “was delivered on the estimated date”. Which it was, but my order wasn’t delivered... an item that was nothing to what I wanted was delivered. So anyone would expect a full refund as the issue was caused by the supplier. I explained this to NIMAT and was just told the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted this item for New Years and now because ASOS made a mistake I won’t have it now for that time. I’m well aware this may sound petty but it’s not the fact that I won’t receive my money or the fact that I have to go out of my way to return the item, it’s because ASOS has a duty of care to all its customers and I feel like today that wasn’t met.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope that no one else has to go through this and I just wanted to share my experience so people can understand. Finally, probably the thing that annoyed me the most was that NIMAT who was supposed to be there to help with my issue ended up ending the chat when I tried asking him another question.\n",
    "👍Very professional responses. 👎10 minutes to get in touch.\n",
    "Frustrating experience recently after many positive orders placed with ASOS.\n",
    "Item ordered on 9th December. Still waiting for delivery and it's now 28th December.\n",
    "Been in contact with ASOS live chat a few times. Just keep getting told to wait longer (now 31st) due to processes out of their control. No replacement offered until then apparently.\n",

    "A very positive experience\n",
    "I had the worst experience with ordering from asos because of the long time period of waiting with enthusiasm for the shipment but when it arrived I found out it was missing items. The customer care were really nice and helped with understanding the situation and solved the problem that wasn’t necessary to even happen in the first place. Thank you.\n",
    "Customer service is excellent!\n",
    "But the delivery sucks.\n",
    "I have to use Express delivery next time!\n",
    "I ordered two items 27 days ago, but my order is still nowhere to be found. Asos and their carrier Gnewt do not agree on the whereabouts of the order. They started investigating today after I contacted them both.\n",
    "Contacted Asos through Facebook chat to ask when next day delivery cut off was. They answered immediately with 11pm so I placed my order at 9:30pm as it was needed for the next day. After visiting twitter, I saw on their twitter feed that the cut off was 9pm. Contacted them to cancel the order or confirm that I would have the order the next day, to receive no reply on twitter or Facebook, even though they were replying to messages sent after mine. Managed to contact them via their online chat for them to say nothing can be done and that I had to wait for the order to be delivered before refunded even though it was their fault. Tried to email my complaint for it to bounce due to ‘inbox full’. Bad customer service.\n",
    "I ordered a dress and shoes and they sent me the wrong dress , it stayed it was midi on the packaging but it was clearly a maxi dress, I contacted asos and now the original item that I ordered for a special occasion is out of stock , not a good experience for using this company the first time , I wont be using them again that's for sure ,\n",
    "replaced my stolen shirt even though there was a problem with the delivery company most likely.\n",
    "Customer care team where quick to respond to delivery issues even over the Christmas holidays. Helpful, friendly service. I will however stick to ordering ASOS when I'm in the UK. Most of my orders whilst I've been living abroad have had at least one issue, no issues with this whilst I'm in UK though\n",
    "I ordered a present for my sister at the end of November, the present was supposedly delivered by Hermes they sent a text message to say the order had been delivered at 6.45 and signed for at the address. When I received the text both my husband and I were at home with our 2 children and not one of us heard the door. Soon as I received the text we checked in all the usual places and the order had not been received. This was on the 11th December. I sent a message to ASOS to confirm this information and after having to confirm my address and that I had checked and confirmed the parcel was not in any of the locations they asked for. I then had a second email asking to confirm these things again. I have finally had an email on the 27th December confirming that I will be able to receive a refund, hopefully this will be completed. I appreciate it is a busy period over Christmas, but I do not have the money especially at this time of year to buy 2 presents for my sister so she has now had no present from me on her 30th birthday. I haven’t had an issue with ASOS previously but I have been disappointed by the service this time.\n",
    "It is already 2 month after I made the payment for a package from ASOS.\n",
    "When I finally got the stuff 2 weeks ago things are missing\n",
    "I am trying to get in touch with ASOS and all I hear is we investigate it\n",
    "What about me ? What the about the things I ordered?\n",
    "What about my money!\n",
    "The asos delivery system is very flawed in terms of estimated times and tracking. I couldn't track my order after it had left the UK and when I requested a refund I wasn't helped at all. Major flaws, I don't see myself ever buying from the online store again\n",
    "Joe was very helpful with my answers but I wasn't satisfied with the delivery since I am a long term customers with ASOS.\n",
    "Worst customer service I have ever dealt with\n",
    "\n",
    "If I could give 0 stars I would! This has been the worst customer support I have ever dealt with. I am trying to find out how to get my tracking information for a return so I know when I would get my refund. What I dealt with was the customer rep trying to argue what 10 business days were and that I needed to find proof of postage. First off, regardless of the time period, they could not tell me how I would need to get proof of postage when using the return label that was provided to me in the shipped item. When they could not provide more detail instructions, I confronted with a passive-aggressive, rude customer rep who would be told me that no one could help me. I kept asking for clarification and asking what could be done if I used the return label that was provided by ASOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dealt with shipping items on a daily basis and what they told did not make sense for US customs. Clearly, they did not understand the difference between the two cultures.\n",
    "\n",
    "If ASOS is going to have customer service reps like this, they have lost my business and future businesses. This is ridiculous; I am just trying to get a refund on a small previous purchase, which shouldn't be this difficult.\n",

    "Served by a very rude individual on live chat who was blatantly unwilling to help. They will take your money but refuse to help with a missing refund. Awful customer experience\n",
    "ASOS is seriously a legit site! I have made many purchases and never had issues! I also made returns and I love their free returns, I would receive my refund in 2-3 days! They have a online chat system on their website which is really helpful and their site is very easy to navigate. I'm an ASOS Customer for life!\n",
    "The online chatting service is available 24/7 which is great so you don’t have to stress till the next day or the next working day to have your issue resolved. They are quick to reply and very helpful. I am one Satisfied customer :)\n",

I contacted Asos live chat to cancel the order as Monday would be too late and they told me I can’t cancel my order! I then asked to make a complaint and was told that complaints are handled internally so I would not receive a response to my complaint. I contacted them again on twitter and email, never received a response. I have had to open a PayPal dispute to hopefully get my money back, Diabolical way to treat customers....never again !\n",

    "I ordered my parcel and paid for next day delivery so it would be here on Xmas eve in time for Christmas. I left delivery instructions for the parcel to be left in the porch. The dpd driver Harnek  didn’t bother to read the instructions left for the driver and decided to take a picture of my drive. I assume he didn’t even get out his van as there was no sorry we missed you card just a text sayin your delivery won’t come until after Christmas. I tried calling multiple numbers which were all automated voices and no help I phoned ASOS direct and got put on hold then hung up on. I was told I can’t collect it from their depo as the delivery address on my ASOS account had my partners name on with the same address. So after trying everything I could to receive this parcel I gave up as not one person seemed like they wanted to help. I had no choice but to wait for my parcel to be delivered today then get a text today (Friday 27th) saying your parcel will be delivered on Saturday 28th! I did not request this and this is now becoming extremely frustrating. I phoned ASOS to see why this has changed and they put me on hold then hung up on me. I phoned dpd and they told me they can’t help my parcel won’t come today and that ASOS has changed the delivery to tomorrow. I can not be bothered to be put on hold for ages then get hung up on or speak to people that have no intentions to help this is the worst customer care team I’ve ever spoken to and it’s such a shame as I did like ordering from ASOS but after this I won’t be and will send my items back.\n",
    "ASOS has always been a very reliable service for me. I know that sizes are mostly accurate and photos on the website are true.\n",
    "The customer service side is also great, I recently had an issue which was admittedly my own fault but it was dealt with very quickly especially considering that it is the busy festive season so thank you Jodie from the customer service team!\n",
    "Awful delivery partner - Hermes.\n",

    "Still waiting a week later for a parcel, that were Christmas presents. Was told to get in touch at 23.59pm on the 24th December. When I went to do so the chat was offline. I'd sent a message through facebook earlier that day and I'm still waiting a reply. It's now the 27th. The advice now is to wait 48 hours for a replacement order to be processed so god knows when that will be delivered! Instead of keeping customers happy they make excuses for the delivery company. You'd think they would send the replacement order with another company and get it sent next day to make up for it, or even some sort of good will gesture. But no! Absolutely useless.\n",
    "You guys are ridiculous I am never using you again I hope you know that ! You lost my dress then can’t even replace it !!!! And I ordered it 2 months ago !! And can’t even offer compensation!! I don’t even care about the compensation as much as I do the dress. I love that dress and can’t believe you guys took so long to replace it that it sold out. I told you yes replace it and you continued to keep messaging me asking if I want a replacement then it was sold out. Ridiculous!!! Poor poor customer service I can’t believe it.\n",
    "Great costumers service\n",
    "This is my first time to shop on your website. I ordered on 29th, Nov. 2019. Today is 27th, Dec. 2019. I still didn't receive my package. It is really crazy.\n",
    "Excellent experiences! Items as described, fast shipping, free returns, fast refunds, student discounts...etc.\n",
    "Rebecca was very helpful assisting and solving my problem.\n",
    "My problem couldn't be fixed but this store is good.\n",
    "Ordered xmas presents on 18th December after checking that the delivery times were sufficient for xmas. Received an email from hermes on 21st to say parcel received and on it way that day. Then had an update to say parcel delayed at 23.45 that evening. Have contacted Asos to ask them to investigate as now 6 days on theres no further update. Asos dont seem to be concerned that my package is lost with the courier and tell me I have to give it untill the 9th of Jan before they can raise it as a lost parcel as they have to wait for it to come back after 3 failed delivery attempts!!!!  It has not even been attempted once its lost within the courier....... Thats 21 days from order!!!!!! Its clear Hermes have lost the package so why it takes 21 days to be able to claim is beyond me. Asos customer care is a big fat 0. I'll order elsewhere\n",
    "Hannah was very helpful and passed on my issue to a Customer care person.\n",
    "I needed to exchange the size of an item. With initial order I received 25% promo discount. To exchange the size, I need to return an old order and pay 8 Eur for return and re-oder the right size, however 25% discount was not re-applied. Which is totally unfair for the customer.\n",
    "I placed a large order for my sons Christmas and birthday presents (his birthday is the 26th December) on the 20th December. I paid for next day delivery to ensure we received the order before Christmas. To date I have not received my order, have no confirmation of when it might arrive, have been offered no explanation from ASOS (only an ineffectual ‘sorry’) and no compensation for the fact both his Christmas and birthday were ruined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asos take customer service and customer care to a new level of low!\n",
    "I got half of my package delivered, so I contacted customer service and they helped me immediately.\n",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the live chat and my asos assistant was very helpful. He managed to sort out my problem. Thank you.\n",
    "A lot of choises on the website, easy to navigate.....fast shipping and excellent communications with returns or refunds\n",
    "Nisha who helped me was an absolute legend she resolved everything for me. I contacted ASOS in the past with no help at all but Nisha resolved everything same day so thanks.\n",
    "Chelsea was very helpful and made things straightforward for me. Thank you\n",
    "You’re service is appalling - I spend a lot of money with yourselves and you just treat me like a number, failing to see the human the other side. Sadly you’re just another standardise message customer care team with no imagination or legitimate care for your customers.  I had four orders lost over the Christmas period and at the 27th December I am no closer to them being refunded or located. I have been through hours of customer care with no return.  PLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY as I can assure you the stress is not worth it. As a customer of six years I will be switching to Topshop as they are much more reliable, reasonable and caring.\n",

    "Very disappointing and bad experience. Ordered some shirts during black Friday sales, 6 Decemeber. As of 27th of December and multiple messages to asos about my package, I am  now told it was returned on the 21st. Asos won't re ship the package and have to process it before providing a refund, 14 days. Sales are no longer going so cant get the same deal. All I get from Asos is their policy over and over again. Used to get good service from Asos, not anymore.\n",
    "I really appreciated the quick delivery. I unfortunately had to return my order, I wanted the clothes, but they didn't fit right. The Live Chat...Paul...was a great help with answering a question I had with that.\n",

    "All the items are still in stock so why have they refunded rather than replaced? Because they have no idea about customer service.\n",

    "Absolutely awful received my return on 2nd December\n",
    "No refund have contacted them so many times to be told can’t find it ! No refund\n",
    "Shocking !!!\n",
    "Very helpful. Sorted out my query immediately.\n",
    "I got a quick response and had my problem solved just as quickly. I was satisfied.\n",
    "Was not helpful at all. Requested a refund on items I was not pleased with. Refund took longer than the normal allotted time. When I contacted them to ask if they could just credit my account instead of the card used to make purchase, I was instructed I would have to wait another 10 business days. Really sad about this because I love asos and shop with them often, but they just lost a loyal customer. Bad customer service and not helpful at all. Empathy is needed in this world and this company has none.\n",
    "Terrible experience. Avoid!  The worse customer service ever. No parcel arrived after ages waiting  before as, no refund, no communication, hours trying to sort online and Asos staff contradicting each other. One day they promise a refund, then they claim being delivered, then nothing, then back to they will speak with courier, then nothing. Avoid. Just buy things in a shop! I have no goods, no xmas presents, no refund, no explanation. This has been going on for weeks!!!\n",
    "My order was cancelled but was not told about this only untill I contacted them. If I hadn’t have contacted them I would’ve been charged the full price still. Arranged for my order to be resent and I finallly received my order but had missing items. Had to go through their online chat service 4 times on different occasion to get confirmation. Still waiting on my missing items.\n",
    "Thanks for that kind of care and understanding. Appreciated.\n",
    "Riza was a delight! However the situation on not getting a response from the specialist team was upsetting I’ve been asking for help since 12/24\n",
    "I contacted customer service to to enquire about a price change on my items from when I ordered to when I received them. I suggested that instead of all the re-packaging and courier costs, not to mention the impact on the environment, could Asos not just refund the difference back to me.\n",
    "Unbelievably, they requested that I re-order the exact same items, and return the existing ones. 😳🤦🏽‍♂️\n",
    "Carrier notified they had delivered package, but was nothing at my door. House and garden are fully lit up at night. Contacted yodel who gave me driver’s number. Only answering machine. Contacted your help centre which was perfect. Understood the problem and are trying to fix.\n",
    "Leonardo was name and was extremely helpful\n",
    "Very clear, quick efficient chat that resolved my problem straight away.\n",
    "Carlos was very helpful and resolved my issues quickly 10/10!!\n",
    "Glaiza was brilliant in helping me find out if my parcel had been dispatched! Excellent service and I will definitely be shopping with ASOS again! Just hope the parcel does arrive in time for my holiday!!\n",
    "Very prompt help - I was inactive in the chat due to work and my questions were still answered before the chat automatically ended. Thank you!!!\n",
    "Needed help with a lost parcel. Dealt with easily.\n",
    "Helpful chat with customer team member Genisis , following a late delivery that hasn’t arrived. Don’t usually have issues but they were very helpful and quick to raise a query with Hermes and hopefully will be resolved soon. The customer service process is a bit of an annoying loop until you can speak to someone after a robot but it was quick if you have an actual issue that’s showing on your orders. It would be good to have an easier process to speak to a member of the team but Genisis was really helpful. Thanks!\n",
    "Liezel was the most unhelpful person I could have ever met.  It took them 40 minutes to raise a return (that I could have done myself).\n",
    "Elaine was great and very patient, she really knows how to treat a customer. Great work!\n",
    "Everything was sorted promptly and correctly\n",
    "Thank you for your help\n",
    "Very helpful, extremely quick. I was very happy with my service today, thank you Francisco\n",
    "Not the least bit helpful, similar to most of my experience connecting with issues via the Asos chat. Spent 30 mins trying to solve a simple problem and left the chat before resolving the issue but after asking if she could help me further before waiting for my answer and confirmation that the issue was solved. A clear lack of understanding on how to troubleshoot the issue at hand.\n",
    "Parcel was never received after stating it was delivered by Hermes (useless courier) so Lea, promptly raised an investigation for me and said my puppy was cute so can’t not leave a review 😂\n",
    "My experience is good, I'll send back the shoes, the agent said I'll receive the shipping payment, because you send the wrong shoes, so that's ok, thank you\n",
    "Your customer care team have been fantastic in dealing with my lost parcel,\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done great customer service that is really appreciated\n",
    "bad service\n",

    "Thanks, very helpful chat assistant.\n",
    "Very helpful and helped with every question I had\n",
    "Complaint logged after a lost delivery, failed repeat order and no communication from asos.\n",
    "Tried ordering but then told asos blocked my account, thought I would change my password but that did not help. I am a premier customer and i told the advisor online when I finally got through, who said there was nothing they could do and they would escalate, as I needed an outfit ASAP it was agreed I could set up another account and pay next day delivery and then asos would waive the delivery, however this was this morning at 10am and I have contacted them via chat- can't get through and messaged them on insta and I'm still waiting for a response. Firstly, how can you just block an account and not resolve the issue and how come you don't respond to messages? What is the point of paying for premier package and i cannot get the benefits- ABSOLUTE JOKE!!!!!! I guess i will stick with shopping with PLT as they reosond to queries via WhatsApp, with no issues.\n",
    "Great rep. Understood my issue and helped immediately\n",
    "Wrong item delivered, the process from wrong item to correct item is unsatisfactory. I will find an alternative supplier for what I should have received. A very disappointment customer.\n",
    "Wonderful help from Bernadette helping me with my missing item and quickly helping me by arranging a replacement.\n",
    "Very quick and efficient customer service.\n",
    "Usually a great and reliable service from ASOS but since the continued use of Hermes as a courier the majority of my packages are either delivered late (despite me paying for premier delivery) or missing altogether. This is starting to put me off from using ASOS at all as I’ve now had several items I ordered for a specific event that have not arrived on time despite me ordering weeks prior and then having to spend time attempting to track down the package.\n",
    "I had a great attention, very fast and could give a request to my query\n",
    "had a problem with printing a returns label at my chosen collection point but the help team got it sorted in a matter of minutes.\n",
    "Paulo resolved my problem efficiently, I got the refund email once after I finished the chat with him!\n",
    "There parcel courier are liars and thieves. They said they delivered and left it on my doorstep nobody was home that whole day. Emailed asos 3 times first 2 replies they repeat \"check obvious places\" there is only so many times over a month you can check w places for a parcel and now it comes to refunding they are not replying back. Disgusting customer service and thieving yodel. Strongly recommend NOT to shop with asos or yodel\n",
    "Fernando was very helpful and everything went fast!\n",
    "SHOCKING\n",
    "To have agents chat to you and only tell you please wait whilst it’s with our specialist team, and after 5 days there is still not a response or result of the case. Unbelievable to think a company can be happy with this as service. Not an apology in sight.\n",
    "Hermes lost my parcel and the ASOS customer service I received to resolve this issue has been amazing they are very friendly and helpful. I was able to get on contact with someone in less than 5minutes and they did everything you expect from a good service\n",
    "I spoke to REI whoever they are and i was very unhappy with their terrible customer service. I then asked for the complaints address so i could write a formal complaint and they refused to give it to me. Never have I experienced such terrible customer service. The people on the other end really have no clue what they are doing or how to resolve issues. I am deeply upset. I would avoid Asos and go with someone else with better customer service.\n",
    "I contacted customer care with a difficult issue to resolve as, through fault of my own, I had attached the wrong label to my parcel. I contacted the customer care on two accounts, both of which were very helpful. Charles was the care assistant to resolve my query and did so very efficiently. Very pleased with this sevice.\n",
    "5 people joined my chat. I still haven’t received the refund I requested over two weeks ago for an order which was supposed to be received a month ago but never arrived\n",
    "Quick and satisfactory resolution. Thanks\n",
    "The ASOS customer service team has been great via chat. I’m taking off 1 star because I pay for premier delivery and my order has still not shipped 2 days after I placed my order.\n",
    "Quick & efficient response to my query\n",
    "The customer care team was fast and very friendly, providing multiple solutions for my issue.\n",
    "Awful service taking so long and having to repeat myself on the chat. I expect a full refund of my annual subscription for next day delivery.\n",
    "Mia was really helpful and efficient. Great customer service :)\n",
    "I had an issue with a returns QR code. Arnold quickly looked into this and created a new returns label for me\n",
    "Short and helpful.\n",
    "Didn't receive a product of my order and got a refund.\n",
    "Thank you.\n",
    "Ever since ASOS started using Hermes for deliveries in my area my orders are either lost or horrendously late. Not renewed my premier delivery as made no difference as second class post with Royal Mail was far quicker.\n",
    "Was unhappy but customer service was helpful and John tried his best to give me the best advice and information he could.\n",
    "Great customer service very polite and helpful\n",
    "As always my advisor was very helpful with my queries and everything was sorted. Great customer service!\n",
    "I typically have no issues ordering items from ASOS, but this past experience has been the worst. I ordered shoes the first week of December to wear for the holidays and the original package arrived to fedex empty (or was stolen). I have been trying to get a replacement ever since with no luck. I have reached out at least 5 times (lost count) if not more and have yet to receive a new delivery confirmation or refund. Not to include the only way to contact customer service is through chat (which is so frustrating).\n",
    "I’ve always loved shopping with ASOS, they’re a reliable company, they keep up to date with the trends and the ASOS team are friendly and very efficient. They always effectively resolve an issue, should one arise.\n",
    "I haven’t received my asos order. Contacted for an update where they advised they would contact the delivery company and email me once they have an update\n",
    "I love ASOS, but Skynet delivery is a nightmare. I ordered things for Black Friday, after a while I received a letter that delivery would be delayed by 2 days. The package was not delivered even after 2 days. I wrote to support a couple of times and each time they told me a new delivery date. I still haven't received the parcel. Judging by the reviews on Google, I'm not the only one who got into a similar situation (people have been waiting for two months and still haven't received their goods). ASOS should change their shipping partner if their customers are important to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "P.S. Nicole from customer care was kind and helpful, thanks!\n",
    "Nicole helped me refund 3x delayed orders quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "Customer service was rubbish and didn't resolve the issue at all. Giving a discount code for a future purchase, useable on certain styles only wasn't an answer to the problem at all. It was also only a discount I used advertised by your own app so a really rubbish response. The agent also didn't fully understand me so that wasn't helpful either.\n",
    "I really liked asos,but my recent experience has been horrendous. My account was blocked on 23 december due to 'suspicious activity'. No explanation of what and when. I have been shopping with then for a while and this is not a credit account,  nor have u made returns . I have been on chat , first told just change password and email them when done. Did that , only then receive an email of 'no reply email\". Changed password and still says it is blocked.. Been on chat 3 times and sent emails since then and nobody is getting back to me.  Chat says it is with their specialist team ?? However nobody from the specialist team has contacted me. Over a week now and nowhere. Lost out on the sales , for something that isn't my fault with zero customer communication\n",
    "The first person I spoke to on chat didn’t answer me for over 5 minutes then told me to stay in chat and he would transfer me and then ignored me for 45 minutes!\n",
    "The second person I spoke to was wonderful!\n",
    "Non existent customer service and company policy not inline with consumer contracts regulations. When called out on this they continue to deny your rightful refund of outward delivery charges by claiming that your delivery contract isn’t with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disgraceful and I’m sure cynical approach designed to mislead the younger and less experienced customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice - go to money saving expert and find out your consumer rights - then persist.\n",
    "I am disappointed & dissatisfied with ASOS as I have made an order that should’ve arrived yesterday but I haven’t received anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yodel is the worst delivery service boycott them & im genuinely scarred from Asos how they have messed up my order it was worth £200 they have robbed me blind.\n",
    "the guy from the costumer care helped me a lot with my problem about my refund.\n",
    "Second time I’ve had to use the online chat. I’m sure it could be made a lot simpler & quicker to use. It’s very laborious. Took almost 30 minutes to work out the wrong item had been sent & get a return sorted & correct item re delivered.\n",
    "Velvet was helpful and solved my issue quickly\n",
    "the delivery date of my order was 20.12.  however, neither  20, nor December 24, nor 30 I didn’t get it.  in support spread hands, no feedback other than clichés phases, no reimbursement either. thank you ASOS for the spoiled holidays\n",
    "OK so I have been an Asos customer for almost a year now. In that time I have placed quite a few orders and I have sent 80% of the items back. Why? Because it seems the Asos brand are cheap items from China and the sizing is incorrect for English people. My experience have been tops have been too small and not in line with the size they say they are, but the shoes have been the worst. Blisters on the back of the heels. It was only when I switched away from Asos brand it stopped. Today was icing on the cake. I am a paid up member for Premiere Next Day delivery, I paid them a tenner for this. They promise next day. OK so I place an order for some clothes to come tomorrow for a party today. Yesterday, Hermes said out for delivery... They never arrived. So not only are Hermes a terrible delivery company but Asos are too. I spoke to them on their live chat as they will not give out a phone number or an email (another red flag on a poor company) and I said will you either refund or extend my premiere delivery for the next year based on the fact you wasted my whole day waiting in yesterday and I paid for next day service. You wanna know what they said? ... No... lol I said fine, I'll vote with my feet, adios!\n",
    "\n",
    "I should have gone to town, should have gone to River Island / Next and bought the items I needed. You never get what you pay for with Asos and the delivery is a joke, but to refuse to refund me my tenner or extend it for another year, they would rather say, tough and just keep that ten quid. Terrible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deal with them at your own peril!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "EDIT: Would you believe, Hermes delivered parcel today, but to the wrong address !!! #fuming\n",
    "Absolutely terrible experience. I’m so furious. My order was lost. I wrote twice to customer support and I was asked to wait a little bit longer that everything is okay and my order is on it’s way as planned. In this order were New year presents for my sister and my best friend. I wrote to customer support again today, and I was told that my order is missing. So everything before it was just a lie from customer support that order is moving, because according to tracking information there was no movement since December 16. So now I left without New year presents. And everything I was “kindly” suggest from Customer-support is to wait like forever until items from my order will be back in stock for replacement and “generous” discount of 20% for full price item for my next order. I asked to replace it with similar items that are in stock. But they refused. And than closed the chat so I couldn’t even reply. YOU CANNOT ACK WITH PEOPLE LIKE THIS!!\n",
    "I don’t need this discount. Cause I would never order from ASOS again with such terrible service. And I’ll make sure to leave as much as I can bad reviews in Internet about Asos and my terrible experience!!\n",
    "Very polite agent. Didn't quite solve my issue,  but fingers crossed it'll be resolved soon.  My main criticism is that I hate the virtual agent that you need to get through first,  before chatting to an agent.  They never solve anything and are just annoying!\n",
    "It used to be quite good website. Until you received a crap product and keep sent them back they blocked you and not give you a refund at all. How bad experience. I will not recommend this ASOS website to anyone.\n",
    "Nicole was excellent and sorted my refund quickly - I’d give her 5 stars.\n",
    "However, ASOS are taking far too long to issue refunds. I appreciate it’s a busy time of the year but I had to contact them twice to get this sorted.\n",
    "They received my items back on the 19th December according to Royal Mail tracking and are nowhere near as fast as they used to be in informing customers of their returns status and issuing refunds.\n",
    "Nicole was really helpful and very reassuring - Also very sweet about wishing me well with Covid 19. The information was clear and concise.\n",
    "Ashliee was very helpful with my enquiry of a lost parcel with Hermes.\n",
    "Super helpful agent, answered all my questions and was very kind with their responses. Let me know when they needed some time to look into my situation which I appreciate so I wasn’t left hanging. Overall just a lovely helpful assistant.\n",
    "Hadn’t received my refund in weeks. Managed to get through to a person on the online chat thing. Was on there for probably 15 mins. It was so quick and got my refund email straight after the chat. Very helpful.\n",
    "Best customer service as always. Very helpful and approachable staff. Godbless you all\n",
    "Excellent, as always.\n",
    "Parcels arriving TOO late and not even to my address or close to it!\n",
    "Brian was incredibly helpful and understood exactly what I opened the chat for, assisting my intentions 'To a T', couldn't have asked for a better customer support staff to assist me.\n",
    "Absolutely love shopping here but I find it Absolutely ridiculous that they don't state the price when applying the discount. So when issuing a return or a refund they take a discounted price off the price you already paid, I complained about this and the lady who works there kindly enough shown me what I was going to pay but when I applied the discount, she shown me what I actually paid ( now this is not stated in your orders or your receipt, only in the office so this is why I couldn't see!) So, If im the one paying for it, I would like to see what im actually paying for and where my discount actually lies within the order itself - meaning I would like to know which item received the refund and which item didn't but I cant see this, unless I complain and this is something I don't want to be doing. There is nothing on your website explaining the process so thankyou to the kind lady who did!\n",
    "Please update your website by allowing customers to see what they are actually going to pay, if a discount is applied and when sending a confirmation email, also state it on here too ( show the buyer the actual price, so when a refund is being issued or q return they don't think they're receiving less than what they originally bought it for and the people in the office won't get the backlash of it all either.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite frustrating thinking your getting less back than what you actually paid.\n",
    "Brian really helped me in 20min, whereas it’s been 6 month that I was waiting for this code ! Thank you very muchhh 🙏🏼\n",
    "Richard was very helpful and quick with solving an issue for me\n",
    "The assistant was really patient and very helpful and sorted my issue without any problems! Thank you!\n",
    "Contacted and chatted with a very helpful nd polite lady about my missing order, she answered all questions I had and has made me feel reassured that this order is going to be chased up quickly and resolved as quickly as possible for me, especially with it being over the holiday period. Great customer service\n",
    "Ive been using the fast delivery option for 3 days and my orders were being cancelled without my knowledge, the whole point of paying €20 is to get your order as an urgent matter\n",
    "I had a parcel stolen from my doorstep on Christmas eve - as Yodel were horrific enough to just leave it there without attempting to give to a neighbour with no proof of evidence of delivery. Over a week with no refund or resolution so far.\n",
    "Great customer service\n",
    "Always helpful\n",
    "Great services,  solved my problem easy and quick. Thank you!@ As always the best !\n",
    "Awful. I was told my account was blocked over two weeks ago now. Each time I reach out for help they tell me I’ll get an email within 24 hours and I never hear anything. I just requested to raise a formal complaint and the chat handler refused to allow me to and ended the chat. Outrageous.\n",
    "I was having trouble getting my refund back for some parcels that I returned and when it got past the expected date I contacted the virtual assistant. From here someone helped me and within 4 minutes it was sorted and my refunds were issued! Such a lovely person to chat with aswell\n",
    "my parcel has been lost and i.m very angry.\n",
    "Third time trying to fix my problem and they do say third times a charm. Took 5 minutes and the problem had been passed onto someone higher andmy questions answered\n",
    "Awful customer service. DPD left parcel on my doorstep, which is easy access to public and on a road with a cut through. Parcel was taken, no help from ASOS, stating order was delivered so tough!!!\n",
    "I was promised a replacement product but still hadn't received it after 2 weeks. When I followed up on the chat function my query and chat was ended twice without explanation.\n",
    "Needed help with a missing item from an order and their customer service team were brilliant, Sean who I spoke to was so polite and helpful. It was much appreciated\n",
    "Quick connection and resolved my issue with no problem\n",
    "I ordered a coat which had never arrived but was marked as delivered I’ve ended up spending over £300 pound because of the delivery company they use which is yodel. This is not the first time my goods have gone missing when using yodel and I really am not happy about it. The customer care team at ASOS have been great but I am pissed that my goods are missing and I’ve had to order it again.\n",
    "Brian was a good assistant who tried to solve my issue\n",
    "I asked to match an item with a lower price on other websites but my request wasn’t accepted\n",
    "Thanks for chatting. I'm very disappointed. It seems that I will receive my New Year gift in February. The most late order ever....\n",
    "Every FedEx delivery this year has been awful! I have to personally called ASOS every single time to check on status; otherwise, I would not get any delivery until I called. This is really waiting ASOS results and my time.\n",
    "\n",
    "FedEx ground is really the worst delivery service. If ASOS cannot afford FedEx Express service, please consider any other carriers FedEx ground!\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is my package which was supposed to be delivered on Dec 9? It’s a night mare!\n",
    "I ordered our daughter a pair of jeans that she really, really wanted for Christmas even though I was weary of ordering online in the event they didn't fit and had to be returned. Sure enough, they were too small. I tried to create a return on the ASOS website, but couldn't get it to work on any of (3) different internet browsers. CLINT SAVED THE DAY by promptly responding to my chat message, registering the jeans for a return and emailing me a return label and instructions.  Because of this level of customer service, I assure you I will be ordering from ASOS in the future!\n",
    "I spoke to RINNO and he was FAB! Very helpful and sorted out my order issues right away! Very polite and a pleasure to talk to! Thank you 😊\n",
    "There’s no worse customer service in the world. And you’ll never get your clothes. Months will go by.\n",
    "Audrey from CS is very helpful and friendly. ASOS provides top notch customer service.\n",
    "Arlene was very helpful and answered all of my questions well.\n",
    "Asos blocked my account without concern. I made two orders and the two of them were missing items. I asked for a refund cause i cant wait again. They blocked my account, they didn’t send me my money back and also I cant do orders anymore cause I am fully blocked from their system.\n",
    "This is unprofessional..\n",
    "I must always contact you guys for a refund. This is absurd. I should not have to do this with every return you should automatically issue a refund. Stay stealing peoples money.\n",
    "I placed an order on September 15th and was given an expected delivery date of September 24th. I was leaving for two months for work in early October and when I left the package had still not arrived. I figured at that point I would get it when I returned from my trip because there was no way the delivery would not come for two months. However, I returned home in early December and the package had still not arrived. I then went to the Asos website to receive assistance, I was told an investigation would begin with FedEx. I did not hear back from Asos for two week after that so I reached out again. I was told that the investigation found that FedEx was not able to find my parcel. This information seemed readily available to the customer support representative but no one told me, the customer. I was then told that I could receive a replacement order, however, due to changes in stock level, they may not have everything I ordered and I would be refunded for those products. I do not see why I would order from Asos again, the order is over three months late, may not have everything I ordered and no additional compensation was even offered, the prices may be good but I feel better off paying extra to actually get the clothing that I pay for.\n",
    "Joanna from Asos was brilliant with her customer service. really did what she needed to do to help me. best experience i’ve had by far.\n",
    "Rei was rude and a abrupt. I didn’t know where my order was and after speaking to numerous advisors Rei wasn’t helpful considering my order was placed 2 weeks ago for Christmas delivery. I run my own business and would not speak to a customer like this. They then left the chat.\n",
    "My package has not been processed yet but he was kind of enough to explain what is going on!\n",
    "Very helpful, swift reply\n",
    "Reliable as a company for products, not had issues on that end and I've been shopping for several years pretty safely however it's only just arose to me the issues with their customer service. It's all online which makes default responses and cop out answers easy and I made a tiny error on picking the wrong delivery address due to having a default option and ASOS can't change this. A weird policy about not amending orders after 15 mins of ordering? My parcel hasn't shipped out yet so now would be the perfect time to resolve it but ASOS refuses so now I'm stuck hassling the couriers after they've been instructed otherwise. Makes zero logical sense and I'm genuinely frustrated at how minor an issue it is.\n",
    "I purchased 2 orders and was failed to be delivered,, and i chated with REGYN and helped me a lot offering me a refund or replacement,, big service big online shopping and why sometimes orders failed to be delivered they are here always helping us.\n",
    "Joana in the customer service is wonderful! Solved my enquiry so quickly- thank you Joana!\n",

    "Pleased to have immediate attention to look into order and refund issues. Give confidence to continue on line purchase with Asos\n",
    "Great help! ! Very understanding!\n",
    "paid £6 for next day delivery, still no sign of the parcel. no way of communicating with customer service and no update from Hermes. absolutely shocking and waste of money. Asos sort it out!!!!!!!!\n",
    "Parcel left outside of the house. Received a note saying the parcel was left outside. Asked for assistance, had to ask the neighbours before this could be settled as it is part of their checks. Inconvenience on my part as the buyer and the neighbours whom I would be bothering.\n",
    "I have experienced an extremely poor customer service tonight. I’ve spent 4 days trying to get something resolved. 2/3 of the agents were awful and even ended the chat on me after 40 mins. It’s put me off buying from ASOS again.\n",
    "I placed an order and I really needed these slides in time for going away, I waited weeks as it was Xmas time, they finally came in 3 sizes too small instead of 9 I got 6.\n",
    "I contacted customer chat and Earl created a replacement for me which will be sent within 3 -5 days 🙂\n",
    "Fobbed off..ordered 25th November, item shipped 9th Dec, parcel at Hermes hub from 11th December and not moved! Online chat advised to wait 48 hours for investigation with Hermes and replacement would be sent if parcel lost.I said I would re-order no problem and return the delayed/lost parcel for a refund if Hermes finally delivered it. Was assured it would be sorted, the advisor said there was no need for me to re-order so I didn't re-order.No communication from Asos. Online chat again, asking me to wait until midnight, i.e. 60 hours after investigation lodged. Still nothing. 80 hours passed, now 23rd December, advisor asked that I wait...again? I said no, I was told 48 hours and it's now 80+ hours, send me a replacement and you take up the issue with Hermes! Was told if items in stock, replacement would be sent, if not, they would refund. Checked status of stock online - in stock. Within 2 hours of chatting to online person, I got an email to say a refund was on it's way. Thanks Asos for letting me down, 2 presents short on Christmas Day, one for partner, one for son in law. Maybe you should be sacking Hermes off and getting a more reliable company to deliver your goods.\n",
    "Thank you, good answer\n",
    "I ordered a dress for New Years eve. I ordered it on the 13th of December with next day delivery. It somehow got lost and I contacted you 4 times. Its now the 29th and still no sign of the dress. I am extremely disappointed as it means I am now dressless for New Years.\n",
    "I wanted to return 4 items from 2 different orders. The online advisor was super helpful and arranged everuthing very quickly for me. Excellent customer service!\n",
    "Awful customer service. I tried to return an item online but couldn’t get a Hermes label so I tried to contact asos to get them to send me one. I tried for weeks of emailing and messaging with no response. I finally got in touch via a live chat and was then sent the wrong label. I got back in touch on a live chat and finally managed to send my parcel off. I then received an email saying that I could not be refunded my money only a credit voucher. I spoke to someone on the live chat about this who was very i helpful. I send her photos of emails I was sent to prove I had sent my item back but she still said she could not help me. I will never shop with asos again and I will not be recommending this website to my friends or family. A truly shocking customer service experience.\n",
    "Bought clothes from cyber monday(November).\n",
    "They never arrived.\n",
    "I tried to contact their customer service but their live chat never works and they do not have a number or email.\n",
    "After complaining through resolver and saying I want my items as they are Christmas presents, they refunded my order without even asking just days before Christmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "I complain further and they offer me a tiny discount code but the prices are so much more than previously done that I would be paying more than my previous order.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have been unhelpful and unprofessional throughout the entire experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend to avoid\n",
    "quite surprised how quick and easy it was to get hold of someone to sort out my queries. Marc helped and sorted everything I had asked about.\n",
    "I had not received a parcel and the delivery company was not updating me. customer care were easy to contact and were able to find out what had happened and processed a refund immediately when requested. Excellent service, even during the busy holiday period.\n",
    "I had a problem with my return label\n",
    "Some of my parcels weren't delivered but the customer support offered by Asos was amazing. They helped reach a Solution in which both of the parties were mutually content.\n",
    "very disappointing .  I ordered 2 different styles of jeans in both size 14 and 16 . I was sent 2 pairs of sizes 14 and 16 both in the same style of jeans .  One pair of jeans came later in a separate parcel which meant having to do 2 separate returns .  I am still awaiting a refund for the pair of jeans which came late  : (\n",
    "Efficient, resolved matter very quickly.Excellent manner polite & courteous, a 5 star rating\n",
    "You should consider what delivery companies you do business with. Hermes being the company in question.. they don’t bother delivering your parcel until i have to complain through asos. Only then do I mysteriously receive it within two days after having it in their hermes depot for over two weeks.\n",
    "After waiting 35 business days for my order and being stuffed around by APGE Commerce and ASOS GB. ASOS NZ distribution centre is holding on to my order. I have been in contact with NZ Post and they have nothing to do with the delivery of this order so I don’t understand why APGE Commerce/ ASOS provide tracking numbers via the NZ Post website. There is no accountability from ASOS hence why there is no contact number to speak directly with a customer service rep only the customer care which is an illusion of actually caring for the customer. This is the worst treatment I have experienced from any retailer online which is a pity because ASOS used to be a great place to shop 5 years ago. Outdated service that is trying to keep up with other fast fashion outlets that provide better customer interaction and service. If I could give 0 stars I would. Shame on you ASOS your business will not go far for very much longer.\n",
    "Advisor was really helpful and knowledgeable.\n",
    "Asos goes beyond expectations. Been a customer for ages and they are quick to resolve any issues when they arise. Brilliant.\n",
    "Iam very disappointed with ASOS I have in the past been a very good customer but I will no longer be I bought 2 lots of gift vouchers to be sent on Christmas day my nephews have still not received them I have spent hours on their so called help line I have got absolutely nowhere they keep telling me that I will receive a email but that has happened either very disappointing I will not be using ASOS again\n",
    "Ordering trainers was a breeze. Paid for express delivery for a certain day. Turns out it was Hermes delivering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hermes at this point of typing this review have NOT delivered on the day I’ve paid an extra £8 for. I had to stay up until 10pm for a delivery that Hermes will never ever deliver as promised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contacted Asos the next day once the time slot had relapsed. They have tried to help me, have raised the issue with Hermes. I don’t blame them at all as they’ve sent my items out but it’s not good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now I have to wait again today to see if they deliver today. Complete joke when £50 has been taken from my bank already.\n",
    "\n",
    "First time customer; now a last time customer until they get rid of Hermes. Hermes are making them look bad when the staff do everything they can to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update:- Fatima has raised the issue and was helpful. However, I have to wait 24-48 hours before they can do anything else for me…..\n",
    "Two of three items arrived damaged. Spoke to customer services and all they could offer was to return the item however both these items are now out of stock. So therefore just wanted compensation to cover repairs.\n",
    "Told by the advisor that their hands were tied which is fair enough so asked to speak to a manager. The agent explained there was nothing they could do either so I couldn't escalate it. I asked for a complaints email address and was told the same team would pick the email up so wouldn't be able to help. I asked for this procedure to be flagged internally but I couldn't have an update on whether or not any change would be implemented.\n",
    "I completely understand procedures and policies are in place but feel this should be altered when there are no more items left in stock.\n",
    "I placed an order for a jacket and unfortunately I received a completely different order today. The package has both my name and delivery information listed on it but it is not what I ordered! This is extremely disappointing and inconvenient. The only option I am left with, is to return the incorrect item as the jacket I ordered is now out of stock. Once again, I am extremely disappointed as a returning ASOS customer!\n",
    "Was very helpful throughout the whole process of the live chat, helped me out as much as he could and responded within a reasonable time\n",
    "Thank you\n",
    "Great help lovely customer service alto I couldn't get s refund but got 15%discount code\n",
    "Several orders made using the yearly premium delivery. One took 25 days to reach me. Yes I agree some of the issues were down to Hermes and their inability to deliver. My contract is with ASOS, who do not reply to tweets. The chat is poor, you get promised we will get back to you.Surprise they don't.  ASOS have made it hard for you to email Them. Again because they are one of the large companies they think very little of the customer.  ASOS is ok if things go smoothly, it's when it goes belly up and they do nothing\n",
    "Non accommodating, no empathy. I felt like i was talking to a robot. My issue was not resolved at all\n",
    "Vey quick and helpful agent .\n",
    "Im happy with service.\n",
    "Very understanding and patient and helped me to the best of my ability even though I was very frustrated. Thank you Juanillo!\n",
    "Helpful, quick resolution\n",
    "ASOS have great customer service. They’re friendly, efficient and really do want to help. I always buy with confidence because of it. Thanks ASOS; we love great products and great service!\n",
    "I spoke to a lovely lady today called Gemma,about my returned order and my refund I had not been able to get the help I needed in my account,Gemma was very helpful in processing my refund,and any queries I had she was very pleasant and customer focused,very happy with the service I recieved today,\n",
    "My package wasn’t received at my house and I’ve been trying to locate someone to help me with this. Customer service was very polite and agreed to help me and to give me a response in 48 hours. Hope to receive good news in a couple of days\n",
    "Very good helper\n",
    "Customer service assistant very helpful and resolved my issue very quickly.\n",
    "My problem was solved quickly and efficiently\n",
    "Raiza was very supportive and helped me feel less worried about an order.\n",
    "Riza Marie was very polite and helpful with the whole process.\n",
    "Got it, fast, very kind. I am pleased with the help and am very grateful!\n",
    "Does not even deserve 1 star, poor customer service to say the least! Have been trying to obtain my refund for over 1 month. Have been promised  it's been raised by atleast 4 differ customer service team members! DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS\n",
    "The customer service reps have been kind. I have spoken to Earl and Carla on separate occasions and they have been really pleasant and understanding. However ASOS customer service overall has been truly lacking. I have been chasing my refund for close to two months. They don't reach out with any updates or information, I have to constantly reach out to them. It's been stressful and honestly this has turned me off from shopping with ASOS. As of now I won't be a returning customer.\n",
    "I had Paula she was great and so patient and just wonderful!!!!\n",
    "Im unimpressed with the amount of months its taking to get a refund for an item I ordered in October. We're coming to the end of the year and still nothing. After multiple promises of a recund and being told there's a technical issue which is preventing me for obtaining a refund, this is disgraceful Customer service on their behalf.\n",
    "Jessamin can be helpful if she is more clear upon the details she requires to help her customer.\n",
    "Customer Service was abysmal. Long, and painful experience trying to get answers to my questions. Poorly worded responses regarding me query informing me I would get a refund- then changed their mind and retracted the original statement regarding the refund\n",
    "Order did not turn up bit they sorted it out straight away\n",
    "The only way to contact customer service is through their web chat, but the web chat doesn't work! I have been trying to contact Asos for weeks now and there is no other way to contact them.\n",
    "I have also tried to message them with Facebook and Instagram but nothing.\n",
    "Lots of people seem to have the same problem.\n",
    "I am still expecting a refund worth more than 200 pound and i also ordered a parcel at the beginning of December has not even been sent yet ( i understand there might be delayes with Christmas and everything, but it is now been a month and i am also paying the next day delivery. All i want now is to speak to customer service and delete the order to have a refund).\n",
    "I will never buy from Asos again.\n",
    "Order 690794196\n",
    "I made a mistake and put the wrong address I contacted ASOS 3 times but they kept me going around around in circles. Once you have ordered they don’t care about you anymore. All I needed was change of address. After organising to get my parcel only to realise one of the hats was wrong which means I had to return it. This order caused me more pain than joy. Be aware when ordering out the right details otherwise they don’t care. Beware.\n",
    "Sean was prompt, kind and helpful. Thank you!\n",
    "Got a wrong item and CS cannot reordered the item for me at the same price (bought on discount) So disappointed and too much effort for customers to fix what they did wrong!!!\n",
    "Great customer service, my query was resolved quickly and the advisor was friendly\n",
    "I was under the impression that ASOS was a UK brand. Later on after placing my order, I found out that there were warehouses in both the UK and the States (there was nothing informing me of the States). After tracking my order I realized it was coming from the closest warehouse to my location (which is the States) meaning I would be charged with customs. I was unaware of this and I couldn’t find anything clear on the site, I searched up questions about this on google but none were straightforward. It doesn’t matter to be how long my package will be but it would be helpful if I was told it was going to be coming from the States. I don’t understand why there’s no option to get my clothes shipped from the UK, as there will be no customs.\n",
    "RizaMarie (I believe the same was), was very helpful, direct and quick to answer my query. Great experience !\n",
    "Daryl was very helpful & solved my problem for me.\n",
    "I ordered the Ivy Park Sweatpants in XS and for some reason I was sent a 3XL, I then had to re-order them and they sent another 3XL when my order clearly states XS. I then returned all items because Asos had no real resolve other than me to keep ordering the same item and they keep sending the wrong size.\n",
    "I was concerned about my package being delayed and Carla was able to assist me right away. Great customer service.\n",
    "My parcel was ordered on 30th Nov (black friday, so I'm aware of delays). But after half my order came, I was left with one Xmas present still missing. I thought I was being clever by ordering early but apparently not as its still hasn't arrived. It still shows that it is in Asos Lichfield on my tracker although Asos now claim it has been delivered, on a day in which I was in all day. I can clarify it hasn't and yes Ive check neighbours etc.\n",
    "I also know as its Xmas time there are probably a lot of enquiries but I've been emailing/messaging about my enquiry since 2 weeks after it was ordered and it's still not been resolved. Asos are normally very good with this sort of thing, I've never had a problem before. But unfortunately this year I was an Xmas present missing on Christmas day.\n",
    "I ordered clothing and paid next day delivery. Ok it was for 21/12/21, It did not arrive then but I had an email saying it would be the 22nd  Fine fair enough. My goods did not arrive on the 22nd. Apparently they were delivered at 17.01 to my address. I was getting ready to go out, and they said I recieved them. Nobody else was in  I did not open the door to DPD! They say I took the delivery. I asked for proof of delivery to which they have not replied. Disgusted by their actions. Customer care is zero!\n",
    "quick response time, query was looked into quickly too\n",
    "I spoke to an advisor and she was very helpful, managed to solve the issue, and was very friendly. I thought the instant chat method is a great idea to solve problems and offer solutions. Thank you so much. Happy New Year to you and all the team! X\n",
    "Resolved my issue very quickly and completed via live chat and email.\n",
    "The Lady who helped me was excellent and solved my issue within a matter of minutes!\n",
    "ASOS used to be a fantastic company.\n",
    "However my recent experience is terrible.\n",
    "I’ve had to spend hours chasing returns and today I’ve chased up an order which was confirmed yesterday as next day delivery ( I have paid for premier delivery)\n",
    "And it’s today I’ve been told it is not coming until the 4th Jan.\n",
    "The asos customer care rep was unhelpful- Jerald and ended the chat whilst I was still asking a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will not use ASOS anymore and will advise others not to\n",
    "Returns service is appalling - travelled to different collect+ drop off points to be told by unbothered staff they were \"too full\" to take any more parcels and that they didn't know when they would have capacity - complete waste of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can such a large and successful company have such a stupid returns system / process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Surely you can have a system that updates the different stores' remaining capacity for parcels? or use locations that have a large capacity for returns instead of tiny corner shops. Ridiculous.\n",
    "I hope to get a refund based on buying early this year and could be outside the returns period mentioned …. I bought very end of October and returns is the 8th November …. Customer service provided me with a QR code to return said item so here’s hoping !!\n",
    "My most recent order, due for delivery well ahead Christmas was just cancelled as it's out of stock (4 days after Christmas). Another order that I made to get clothes for holiday missed it's target delivery date, and arrived whilst I was on holiday. And you can't generate a refund request until the order has been delivered to you, even if the order hasn't left the warehouse (i.e. it's still in their possession).\n",
    "\n",
    "ASOS will be disrupted out of the market altogether before long if it continues down this path.\n",
    "Literally the best customer service. I've used asos for as long as I can remember and I've never had any issues. The quality of products are really amazing and deliveries have always arrived on time. I've never had any issue reaching a customer service member of staff and recently, I had an unfortunate personal circumstance that meant I had to be out of the country and was therefore late to return my items. Not only have the staff been extremely helpful and sympathetic, they have gone out of their way to ensure my refund was issued, despite the fact that it was against their customer policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've emailed with John Vincent, Abhishek and a few other people and I just want to say a huge thank you for understanding, without making me relive the trauma of explaining my situation. I know it's not that deep - it's just product sales and return but sometimes it makes a huge difference to the customer on the other end, as it has me. Thanks again. Joy\n",
    "Helpful, nice and fast❤️\n",
    "Ashllie was very helpful and thorough. She provided me all the information I requested and was very patient. Very efficient and kind in making sure my refund was processed. Gave me ease and confidence that I will be receiving my money back.\n",

    "Quick help. Understood what I needed\n",
    "Fast response and solved the problem efficiently.\n",
    "I had an issue with my return refund which was sent back as a voucher instead of money back. Within seconds, customer care verified my issue and sorted out the matter. Very courteous and quick service. Much appreciated!\n",

    "Would give 2/5 but Paulo definitely mad the process bare able and friendly\n",
    "Very wonderful assisstance, polite and effective.\n",
    "My first online purchase with ASOS as they were a bit cheaper.   Ordered a pair of ASICs running shoes, size UK8.  Shoe box says size 8, trainers inside are size 9.  Should have stayed with regular online store, was a few quid dearer but they can get basic orders right.Am returning goods, so will see how easy that process is, but to be honest, it shouldn't be necessary.\n",
    "A bit slow in processing the refund but they are easy to contact so I really appreciate the service!\n",
    "Helpful and efficient service - issue resolved easily\n",
    "Leonardojr helped with my issue very professionally and friendly. The issue was resolved in a matter of minutes. Thank you!\n",

    "Reached out on customer care- chat.\n",
    "Received reply straight away. Was very understanding and on the same page. Informed me that the size I want is definitely out of stock. Gave me a special code to use for next time.\n",

    "Customer service was efficient and easy to deal with\n",
    "Great Customer Service\n",
    "This is not a review of Asos' products but of their parcels carrier. My daughter ordered over £200 worth of goods from Asos which did not arrive, even though the carrier (Yodel) said that they had been delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, if you look at the 1 star reviews of Yodel over the Christmas period you can see many similar situations where a parcel has not been delivered but the tracking system says it has. This list also documents many cases of parcels simply left at the front door of a property in full view, late deliveries, damaged goods etc. I think that Asos should seriously reconsider their parcel carriers.\n",
    "Spoke to Becki from customer care. She sorted my problems promptly and was over all a massive help. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n",
    "I ordered a gift voucher on the 2nd of December but due to me misspelling the recipient's email it was not delivered. So after contacting customer service chat they said they will amend the email address and send the voucher but it didn't arrive so I've contacted them again and was told they have passed it onto there specialist department and I would get an email. But up to now no email has arrived or gift voucher. If it wasn't for the  fact it's a £100 voucher I would just accept my losses and definitely not order from asos again\n",
    "I used the chat service about returning an item and the advisor Paulo was very helpful\n",
    "Thank you Prince Arthur for sorting my refunds out especially the one that Hermes delivered to the wrong place which clearly wasn’t my house .\n",

    "I'm giving 5 stars because customer service is great. Very helpful and friendly.\n",

    "I rarely have issues, but when I do Customer Care are always quick to respond and do so in a friendly manner. Always able to help where they can!

    "Sorted my issue quickly and reassures me the actual item I ordered with be with me soon\n",

    "Ordered Christmas presents on 26th November with the 'no rush' delivery option, expected delivery 9th - 16th December. As of today (29 December) still no delivery. No assurance from ASOS that the parcel will ever arrive. Absolutely awful experience and completely unacceptable.\n",

    "Ordered a number of items from ASOS before Christmas. The order was split into 2 deliveries. 1 arrived the other did not. Unable to get through to their customer services via ‘chat’ facility so registered the matter via an email on 15.12.21. Still no response received to update me accordingly. I would strongly recommend be very careful when ordering from ASOS.\n",
    "I have previously written a 5 star review about the service I received when I was early on in the process and naive.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used the chat facility a total of 9 times and the operator are always polite, however, what they promise never materialises.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ordered Christmas presents on 25/11/2021, the order didn’t come in the timeframe outline so I began to use the chat facility. Replacement orders were processed 5 times and I was informed each time that I would receive an email to confirm. This email never arrived each time. I was promised I would receive the items before Christmas each time I used the chat facility. They did not arrive.\n",
    "Today I requested a refund, the operator offered me a discount code that was far far less that the original Black Friday discount and could only be used on full price stock within 20 days. I am incredibly frustrated with the process as each time I have used the chat facility it has taken up a great deal of time and I have finished in a far worse off position than I began. ASOS do not seem to rate customer service highly in their business plan.\n",
    "Great support received from ShannenFaye. She was able to sort out my issue quickly and efficiently. Very happy!\n",
    "Wanted to add some info on my shipping address (right after placing the order) but you guys weren't able to help me. I find it silly that I have to contact my local post office instead\n",

    "I recently purchased a few maternity items. I received the items before the expected delivery time, all the items are good quality and fit well. Although I was missing a button from the pair of shorts, but when I jumped online to chat about repairing them, the service girl I spoke with was great and helped me very quickly. My over all experience has been great!\n",

    "After purchasing a Christmas gift on the 13/12/2021, I have to say that hands down this has been my worst experience with ASOS. I am not used this level of poor service from ASOS, so it is a shame.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to be very frank, The only reason I’ve given 1 more star is due to getting a refund in an timely manner but the whole fiasco of trying to work with ASOS when there’s a problem was to be polite… painful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short of it is. My parcel got stolen by your chosen courier driver for YODEL who are trash. This caused major implications as it was a Christmas gift and it wasn’t until I went to my local Depot on the 21/12/2021 to find out what was going on that I was informed that my parcel had been \"missing\" stolen.\n",
    "\n",
    "with time now pressing on, and waiting on the phone to ASOS for anywhere between 30-45minutes multiple times, it went from we can’t help you, to okay we can submit a replacement, but no apologies on behalf of how trash yodel were! The next day I called up again to double check that a replacement had been processed due to the very fine time scale and anxiety of getting it all sorted ahead of Christmas Day. I spoke to a lady who reassured me that my replacement had been processed and to await my tracking information. I had to hope and pray for my replacement parcel in the hands of yodel again!\n",
    "\n",
    "So to my surprise the next morning I get hit with a “Sorry the item you wanted is OOS” so please tell me…when I asked the lady to confirm that the replacement had been done and she confirmed this, why wasn’t this the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons of why I probably won’t shop at ASOS now after my last visit.\n",
    "I’ve popped them below. I’d rather spend money elsewhere and not have the aggro.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You Use Yodel as a courier!!\n",
    "The fact that yodel are having such bad performance issues and you continue to not hold them accountable and use them makes me question your integrity as a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Web-chat agent don’t have full access to support your issues! When I asked for a replacement due to my issues with yodel, I asked web-chat to help. I requested my new item to be sent to a safe collection point as I don’t trust the delivery drivers. The web assistant told me that this was all done but when I called again to check 4 hours later, i I was told that this was not the case and that your web assistant didn’t have access to do this?\n",

    "3) Incorrect information shared\n",
    "5) Overall Poor service\n",
    "4)lack lustre help from staff\n",

    "A promotional banner was displayed under items not included in the offer. So misleading…\n",
    "Good customer service by Karla, who got me my money back as quickly as possible, but still annoyed that they originally forgot to refund one of my items that I sent back\n",

    "The worst service I have ever received.\n",
    "\n",
    "I placed an order on 10th December. I received the wrong order. I contacted ASOS about this soon after receiving this incorrect order using their online chat. After an hour of talking to an agent, providing them with all the details under the sun of the issue, even photos of the label and all of the incorrect items I had received, the agent gave me ONE MINUTE to reply to their message (they had kept me waiting over 15 minutes already) as they were mid-way through processing the refund and then disconnected the chat. The next evening, I tried again. This time we managed to get through the whole conversation - again I sent lots of photos of the label, the incorrect items etc (quite a lot of hassle considering this was not my fault and someone had stuck the wrong label on the package!). The agent first wanted to process the return for the incorrect items so I waited patiently for this, and printed out the return label I received on my own printer at home. The agent then said they would sort the replacement items for me and that I would receive an email confirming this. I raised my concerns with the agent after a few minutes that I hadn't received anything but I was assured it would be on its way soon and that I should have my items shortly. They also processed a refund for a small item that they no longer had in stock, which was fine.\n",
    "Days went by and I still had received no email, but I had sent their incorrect items back the following day after the online chat. I emailed ASOS Customer Services and, on the same day, received an email from ASOS chasing the return and advising that any future returns might be impacted if I don't return their incorrect items immediately.\n",
    "I received an email on Christmas Eve to say that something had gone wrong - do I want a replacement or a refund. I wanted a replacement but I have zero trust anymore and I will NEVER shop with ASOS again. They still have my money, 20 days later. They were only concerned about getting their items back and had no interest in actually sorting my issue. You can't speak to anyone on the phone and while I'm sure the agents are lovely people, they are more interested in online small talk than actually sorting out someone's problems.\n",
    "It is 29th December and I still have nothing - no items and no refund. I have emailed them back asking for a refund and a goodwill gesture as I have spent over 4 hours trying to get this sorted with no success so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save yourself the hassle and shop elsewhere, you're not missing out on anything!\n",
    "The chat function was easy to use. Levi had great customer service skills in the chat. Very responsive, efficient, and even courteous.\n",

    "Ordered for next day delivery 5 days ago and items never came. Was told to wait 48hrs and if nothing showed up I’d get a refund. 48hrs came and went so I went back into chat and asked for a refund and the woman said I needed to wait another 48hrs. I said no this isn’t what I got told; but she wouldn’t take my word, I sent her a screen shot of the woman earlier saying I could have a refund and then she at last did it for me. For a Premier customer I very rarely have parcels come next day as promised; that’s even if they show up at all. Really poor customer service and a waste of time.\n",
    "I ordered off Asos using next day delivery, however the order did not arrive next day. After a week the parcel had still not arrived, i contacted Asos who told me it was with hermes and would be with me within 48 hours. Over a week after this it still didn't arrive,  when contacting again ASOS told me the item was not in stock and that it would be refunded despite refusing to refund me the week before. Misleading information on the initial communication advising it had been sent when the item was not even in stock? Lost all trust in ASOS and its terrible customer service. I am still waiting on the refund for the item, let alone compensation for having to chase them and wait for something that was never coming!\n",
    "Timoteo was kind, effective and extremely helpful. Thank you always.\n",
    "King helped me fix an error in my order and was really helpful!\n",
    "ASOS to me has always offered me a great service so it’s honestly a shame to be raising this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "I placed an order (consisting solely of Christmas gifts) on the 25th of November giving me, one would think, more than enough time to be ready and receive said items by Christmas Day. Now, after having 4 separate conversations with advisors, I’m writing this on the 28th of December - more than a month down the line - and still have yet to receive my order. Only now has this amount of time (waiting for an order that was estimated to arrive on the 8th of December) warranted a replacement parcel to be submitted for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole situation has been extremely stressful for me - having not received my order in-time it’s resulted in me having to do a whole new Christmas shop, making this month extremely expensive. Being told to constantly wait to hear back within a 48 hour period, only to not hear anything over weeks of waiting at all does not help in making the situation any less distressing for me, and with no attempt of any compensation for the amount of stress this has caused me (a loyal and consistent customer) it has made me lose some faith in ASOS altogether.\n",
    "Mikko was excellent. Very quick to answer my questions and was very nice.\n",
    "Very helpful and understanding. Fast response and support.\n",
    "Annabelle was great- quick and polite service\n",
    "I bought my daughter an e-gift card for Christmas but misspelled her email address so she never got it. My first encounter with support was frustrating, I was told to update my acct details to my daughter's name and he would resend...I thought the voucher, but he sent just the email. MARK helped me today, and was efficient (and funny, which I really needed I was so frustrated). Within a few minutes he had escalated the issue to your technical dept, and assured me that my daughter will get her voucher within 24-48 hrs. Thanks, Mark! He's truly an asset to your team!\n",
    "I went to the post and they sad me, you can't send this from the post. I went to DHL shops, they said, it can't be sent there because they are not allowed to do that anymore. I had to go to another part of town with the kid, to the main DHL branch, they said this return note is for the post. People with the same problem come to them. I spent so much time on one return. Thank you. Never again!\n",
    "I was in needed to print a new return label and the person from ASOS where directly answering me and he helped me in 2 minutes.\n",
    "First time using ASOS and having to resort to this. Customer service was ok, generic.\n",
    "Really helpful and efficient couldn’t ask for better service\n",
    "I wish I didn't have to contact your service again on the same matter, but nevertheless, it was quick, helpful and very polite. Hope with the resolving outcome this time.\n",

    "Customer service extremely slow and an absolute waste of my time over the past month…\n",

    "\n",
    "Now I’m being told I’ll get the refund for price match once they’re delivered? Seems dodgy this I am not liking it one bit\n",
    "Thank you for getting back to me but the package was supposed to have been delivered through my letter box as was said and it wasn't , so I'm presuming it either wasn't delivered or it was stolen.\n",
    "Great assistance\n",
    "I have ordered a parcel from ASOS just before Christmas , as a Christmas gift. I have received the wrong item and have been battling with customer service to have the correct item sent to me. They keep ending the live chats from and have no log of the conversation. I’m repeating myself over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of Customer service is unprofessional and not something I’d expect from a company as big as ASOS\n",

    "They sent me the wrong item, and when I tried to talk to someone about the details, express myself as a customer, and see what other alternatives there are, I noticed there is no way of talking to a customer service agent - no real life live chat, only robot, no phone number, not even an email address. For this reason I will refrain from shopping here again and stick to companies who I can actually TALK TO.\n",
    "Would appreciate if someone from the ASOS team contacts me following this comment\n",

    "I believe I have finally resolved the issue with my order but it was extremely painful. The chat took a total of 46 minutes. I don't know why. It was a simple request: I did not receive the Christmas gift I ordered back on Nov. 15, 2021(expected delivery Nov 22). I asked the chat rep (bot?) to refund my American Express for the amount of the item. Would have much preferred to speak with a real person in real time. Painful. Just painful\n",

    "You have created the problem but do not agree to take responsibility\n",
    "Order didn’t arrive but was sorted with redelivery on the items still available and refund on the rest\n",
    "Purchased a pair of boots from asos. Arrived the day after expected with half a boot. I moved to Amsterdam 2 days before Christmas and of course didn’t bring the 1 boot with me. Asos are declining to give me a refund as I cannot return the 1 boot as I’m not in the country. Absolutely disgraceful, avoid at all costs. Go straight to supplier. Awful customer service\n",
    "Rachel was an amazing help. Very supportive.\n",
    "Cherie provided top notch customer service, she was patient, articulate clear and very very helpful. She knows her job very well and I was happy. I got in touch with someone before her who didnt help at all so I was getting a bit frustrated , but i decided to try again and got cherie.

    "I have used asos for 15 years and never had a problem. It saddens me to have to leave a 1 star review on what should be a 5 star company but since asos are using evri the service has gone downhill. 3 parcels missing and Christmas presents not received and charged £6 to call an automated evri phone line who was no help. I will now look elsewhere to shop for my make up online as I cannot risk my items to keep going missing. Asos change your delivery provider. Evri are a shambles.\n",
    "Ordered from Evri and paid extra for next day delivery as the items were urgent and the courier who delivered to our address said they made an attempt to deliver but we were not in so would try the next day. This was totally incorrect as we were in all day and I live on a military base and there are records kept of who comes on and off camp and they didn’t even come on camp! Utterly unprofessional as the next day we were in a different country and needed those parcels! This is not the first time the courier has done this and it is absolutely appalling behaviour and lazy from them!\n",
    "Not sure why one of the biggest retailers in the UK is trying to save a few quid by using Evri as a courier. Notably voted worst courier service year in year out, even when they were Hermes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not received my parcel yet that was ordered weeks ago for NYE. The live chat is a joke, sent about 10 copies of the same message every time it responded. Evri changed the ‘delayed’ notification to ‘we’ve got it’ and then within 12 hours it was back to ‘delayed’!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute joke, please change to a reputable courier service!!!!\n",
    "Shocking customer service when your delivery mysteriously disappears, unwilling to help or provide any useful information, just keep telling you to contact back tomorrow. Products are good from ASOS but heaven forbid you have a delivery issue, they don't want to know, or more importantly don't want to send out a replacement with a more reputable courier! If I could give a zero rating I would, absolutely fuming.\n",
    "Always easy to connect customers and always helps with any issues\n",
    "After several years of customs, my first return and they blocked my account without giving me a reason and I have to go to my payment processor to get back my money for items which I have returned for over 30 days.\n",

    "Ordered 19th Dec for next day….didn’t arrive for 3 days, got x2 assurances from customer care that it would be delivered before Xmas…..chases again Xmas Eve and was told it wasn’t going to arrive - leaving a total of about 3hrs before Xmas to get replacement presents.\n",
    "Still no further updates, just told to wait 10days….customer care just blame Evri, don’t offer any complaint policy/process and a paltry 10% discount on next order (which ironically they load up as daily offers to everybody).\n",
    "…..still waiting, giving another online assurance it will be with me by 2nd Jan but I look forward to another nonsensical customer care conversation online in 2nd asking what/where/why my order from 19th Dec is.\n",
    "Embarrassing service!\n",
    "Had a hoodie which developed a hole after wearing it a few times. Contacted customer care and they’ve sent me a replacement and there was no long wait to get through. Never had problems with any ASOS items before but I’m glad they were so quick to fix it when there was a problem.\n",
    "Very quick to investigate issue and extremely helpful!\n",
    "They are fast and helpful.\n",
    "Prompt and polite excellent customer service 🙂\n",
    "Please stay away from Asos, horrendous customer service, next day delivery rarely works, ages to get back refund and half items are faulty or been worn before. This company is awful in every area. Just read the reviews\n",
    "Amazing customer service all sorted online without an issue\n",
    "I have ordered products from their website 3 times in a row and none of the orders have arrived until now.  Not to mention that I didn't get the money back either.  Their online customer service chat is absolutely a mockery because no one does anything to solve your problem.i had to ask many times to speak with a manager and they are as incompetent as the rest of the people. The UK office doesn't take any responsibility for the lost parcels or for their delivery partner evri. I have to contact them every day from my time to ask them to do their job and every time I speak with a different advisor I found out that no one did anything despite being rest assured that they are looking into the problem.\n",
    "easy access to the customer service via the ASOS app and was quickly connected to a customer service assistant, who provided a very quick solution to my problem. especially appreciate that I didn't have to wait to be connected to a team member and that I did not have to repeat myself at any point, which i often have had to previously, when contacting other customer services via live chat. this time of took less than 10 minutes overall from looking for the live chat to being provided with an appropriate solution 👏🏻\n",
    "My items have no arrived for 10 days. I was offered a refund 3 separate times, when I said yes I would like one I was told to wait as evri said they might deliver. I asked for a refund on chat and the asos representative closed the chat with me and told me I couldn’t get one. This can’t be right?!?!\n",
    "Didn’t want to write a negative review but generally online shopping with a big retailer is straight forward. Not at all impressed with asos and will be reluctant to use again. Returned over £100s worth of items confirmed on 16th Dec with expected refund date 26th Dec. It’s 29th Dec no refund no update and no way of emailing or phoning customer service through my account just a virtual assistant!!!

Three times ASOS have had to provide me with replacement products or refunds as the parcels had been opened and things taken out before delivery, the parcels are just left on the doorstep in full view of everyone! Surely it’s costing ASOS more money in replacements etc while they’re using this company!\n",

After contacting, apparently I’ve to wait 6 days (with the premier subscription).  I purchased this subscription quite some time ago and had hopes that I would receive orders quicker but it would have been more beneficial to go to the brands directly for the items I wanted.  Great selection to chose from but slow delivery times makes me move to other websites unfortunately.\n",

    "\n",
    "Delivery number 1: Never turned up for 3 weeks and was told repeatedly by ASOS to wait another 24 hours. It was difficult to get through to anyone on the chat at times and to be told at least 3 times to wait, felt like I was being fobbed off. Plus no updates from Evri. Eventually got a refund from ASOS but that was difficult to do.\n",

    "Delivery 2: I re-ordered the one that never arrived and although I have the next day delivery, was given an expected date 3 days in future. This parcel was late too. On the day it was being delivered, I was given a time slot which it was 2 hours late for. By this time I had left my house and had expected it to be a no show! So it was left in my bin.\n",

    "Bought 2 items end of October as Christmas gifts. They do not fit and I wanted to return for a larger size. However they refused as it has passed the returns date. Feel this is poor customer care as I order regularly and all the items are still in original tags and packaging. And I would be rebuying it in a larger size anyway. Point blank refused and no Christmas returns wriggle room. Will be avoiding asos from now on.\n",
    "Ordered something for Christmas next day delivery and still not arrived, asos absolutely useless to get in touch with , sent 2 emails and no reply , shocking service, lost a good customer\n",

    "Problem with my returns, but was sorted promptly through the live chat customer service. Very helpful.\n",
    "Absolutely shambles of a company. My parcel got robbed outside my door and now they wanna block my account and tell me I am barred from using the website! Are you joking me? I wouldn’t mind but the parcel was worth £300 not £3. Absolute jokers!\n",
    "Ordered a few items on the 21st of December & received them the next day really happy with this site & quick delivery will definitely be ordering again with them.\n",

    "Still waiting on a refund of 220 pounds from asos even though i returned the item on the 14th december. After i sent this return they blocked my account. Ive been told refund will be 24th, 28th, and now 2nd january but the \"specialist team\" are apparently looking into things. I am round and round in circles with this absolute disgrace of a company and will not be using them again after this. Withholding my money even though it says its been returned to them is actually disgusting treatment. Honestly, avoid these cowboys. The agent called Dolly has now told me after speaking with agent yesterday that i would get refund and email about it in 24 hours is now saying i may not get it back on 2nd January\n",

I started a new chat and got through to Natalie who almost immediately fixed my issue and was so kind an understanding while doing so. I experienced 2 very different types of customer service experiences from asos today and think that Natalie deserves real recognition because she is a fantastic employee who clearly knows how to do her job and do it well. I'm extremely grateful to her.\n",
    "Didn’t send my item , don’t wanna refund or replace and blocked my account !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But\n",
    "Only way to contact Asos is via chat. Chat function person Manoj just doesn’t respond after 14 minutes and if I want to make a complaint I have to do it via chat which goes to a new chat with… Manoj\n",

    "She sorted the case and came a solution for me quickly\n",
    "The advisor was quick and really helpful. They sorted out EVRI’s mess in 15 mins.\n",
    "When it works, it works well, but when they mess up an order their customer service is worse than appalling. I placed an order with them in mid November and checked online two weeks later for the status update. There was NO record anywhere that I had placed the order. Thankfully I was paying for it through AfterPay, they had a complete record of my order. I contacted ASOS customer service 3 times over 3 weeks and was told it had been referred to their ‘specialist’ team and to wait for an email. Not once did I hear from them again. After 3 or 4 weeks I registered a dispute through AfterPay. ASOS failed to respond to the dispute and AfterPay then refunded me all monies paid. ASOS did not once acknowledge the order existed, despite receiving payment. All my previous orders have worked out well. I’d suggest if you buy from them never pay them direct, always through a reliable third party. I’m deleting the App and will never buy from them again.\n",
    "your chat representative was efficient and courteous\n",
    "Leilani was quick and overall the experience was good.\n",
    "I purchased items that were intended to be a gift for the holidays. First issue, order didn’t arrive on time and I completely understand as company can’t control shipping carriers delays. However, once I did receive order (X-más Eve), upon unboxing, I noticed one item was damaged/broken (tea mug), AND another item was entirely incorrect item that I didn’t purchase. I immediately tried chatting with customer care but to no avail so I went ahead and followed the return process and printed label. After the holidays, I tried reaching back out to customer care to resolve and they asked if I had returned the items, at that time I hadn’t because the shipping carrier was closed due to holiday,  so I asked for refund so I could at least go ahead and replace the item (s) immediately. The rep then said once the carrier was in receipt of the return they could expedite a refund. I totally understood that. We then got disconnected as they even offered a 25% discount but again the chat was disconnected impromptly. (never received coupon code btw). Fast forward to today, I reconnected with chat and requested again a refund as I had the chance to drop items off at shipping carrier. I was then met with conflicting information and repeated a return policy where I have to wait 14 days to Get a refund. This is unacceptable as I was told one thing, then told another. In addition, this is a quality control issue with their packaging/ shipping operations where I was sent the wrong item on top  Of receiving a damaged/faulty item. I would trust business who have no concern to make it right especially with a customer who has spent thousands of dollars with a company. What has happened to realCustomer loyalty and service…..??\n",
    "I returned a pair of pants on 11/23/2022 and as of today, 12/28/2022 I am still waiting for a refund. I've spoken with customer service three times in the last two weeks and I've gotten nowhere. They can't seem to provide me with actual proof that my refund has been processed. All I get are emails stating that I have to wait ten business days for the refund to show in my account. I finally got so fed up with the runaround I've been getting that I filed yet another dispute against ASOS with PayPal. They have been in possession of my returned goods for over 30 days. There is no excuse for making me wait so long for a refund. I will NEVER buy from them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update: after over a month of being given the runaround by their inept customer service representatives, I finally got my refund. I had to file a claim with PayPal and they refunded me the money. The ONLY WAY to pay for things with ASOS is to use PayPal. If they screw you regarding a refund or if your order never arrives PayPal will help recover your money. I've had issues with other companies as well. As long as you document everything regarding your purchase PayPal will use that information to force the companies to refund your money. Even though I ultimately got my refund I will NEVER buy from ASOS again.\n",
    "Asos as a company has really let me down by receiving my refund 8 months late but Suraj was great virtual assistant and really efficient.\n",
    "Horrible,, No phone number, spent an hour in a chat after refusing the automated robot and asked to soeak to a live agent, Ma.Cecilia to resolve several problems,, her asking the same questions, asking for pictures,, i sent the same ones several times ad she kept asking for the same ones, then taking her sweet time between texts, then asking for the same pics i just sent.. Finally after 45 minutes i started wiggin and got vulgar..an hour into this she still kept saying “ bear with me” Holy FK’ seriously a shitshow.  Clothes rarely fit, colors are often way off.. Spending so much time repackaging and driving to shipping locations.. Its awful dealing with this company.\n",
    "Eunice was helpful, friendly and concise in helping me solve my problem.\n",
    "I payed for 2 day shipping on Monday December 26th. I was supposed to have my order delivered today December 28th and the order is only going to be delivered December 30th. 2 days date. This is none excusable. Not how a company should be run.\n",
    "I received a bigger size on a product due to misleading sizing info listed on the app. In addition to that, I had purchased the item with a discount code during a sale. The sale was no longer available and the chat agent was great in working with me to help me get a discount so that I could place another order for the correct size. One of the many reasons I love ASOS.\n",
    "Carissa helped me with my return question. I was confused as to why the return tag on my pants would prevent me from trying them on if I wasn't able to return them afterwards. Great job.\n",

    "Maicah is very helpful and was able to address the issue with my order\n",
    "Carissa was very helpful and solved my issue quickly.\n",
    "I placed an order for next day delivery a month ago which didn’t arrive, I’ve been chasing it up to be told a replacement will be sent which still didn’t arrive. I then told the customer service I’d like a refund which they said will be done by the 25th December and guess what? Still nothing from asos and customer service won’t provide a contact number so I’m currently £300 down due to this company with no sight of an end would completely avoid\n",
    "I pay for next day delivery and again Evri have failed to deliver and ruined my trip and new year outfits, which has caused anxiety. Stop giving the option for next day if you can’t deliver. No good blaming the carrier who used to be Hermes, so you should have researched their track history. You used to use DPD, much better. Cannot trust Asos and I will be going elsewhere as not reliable.\n",
    "I placed an order on 14th of December for next day delivery. It’s now the 28th of December and I have not received my delivery and have had no correspondence except for me reaching out to the chat team. I have spoke to 3 separate people none who have been any help. I asked for a replacement and was told it would be processed I then got an email to say refund on the way that the product was out of stock. The product is not out is stock as I can clearly order it now. I asked to speak to someone higher and was told it wasn’t possible. I have spent over 1 hour trying to sort out this problem. Absolutely shocking customer service and poor behaviour from asos. It’s no wonder Asos have to keep having discounts, why would anyone want to order from such a bad company\n",
    "I have made contact 5 times over a number of weeks & still no solution or the email I was promised has still not been sent. Constant promises but nothing rectified. Very disappointing services.\n",
    "Like other recent reviews have stated. Everything with asos has gone significantly downhill. A lost large parcel of clothes I’d ordered for my husbands birthday and a month later and no delivery. I’ve spoken to them on 4 occasions over this month and they would not refund and continually dismissed my request to escalate this to a formal complaint. They instead kept giving robotic false empathic responses (evidently not genuine and part of their training - I work in mental health empathy only has the deescalation result if it’s authentic and genuine - and there’s real action to rectify the situation) and kept telling me to wait. Eventually after a month agreed to give me a refund as the courier had confirmed it was lost and had the audacity to say they were ‘willing to give me a refund because I was a loyal customer’ erm no that’s the bare minimum in line with my consumer rights. A ruined birthday and no compensation for hours and hours of time and energy spent trying to get it sorted. Shockingly bad asos really. H&M lost a parcel of mine and they were amazing in comparison, I got a refund straight away (within days) no questions asked and they said if my parcel showed up just to keep it (it didn’t) and they also gave me a 20% voucher for the inconvenience. Asos take note, I’ll be shopping at H&M over you all the time now\n",

    "He was patient and was amazing at his work by helping me with my returns.\n",
    "Super greatful to him!\n",
    "Quick and swift resolution regarding issues with refund. ASOS live chat has definitely improved a tonne!\n",
    "Scam site. Beware! They will send you something cheap and only vaguely similar to what you ordered and then make it impossible for you to return it. No cust service phone #, chatbots won't connect you to a person AND their website says that you can return items by logging into your account, clicking on the order and selecting 'return'. This won't work because you won't find your order there. Surprise! VERY BAD and DISHONEST.\n",
    "Stay away from this company absolute disgraceful customer service. Had a problem getting my refund back in the summer for a lost order. Told myself not to use them again. But 20% off for Xmas I made a huge mistake did a big order with them on 13th December I have premier deliver couldn’t possibly go wrong again. Yes no parcel arrived EVRI confirmed it’s lost but every day come back to us for a refund tomorrow.   They lie and lie over and over again. So no Xmas gifts for my daughter now the 28th and no refund. Will never go near  this company again they need investigating. They use the worse courier service in the UK which just adds to the problem. Why is nothing getting done by the owners I.e training in customer service would be a start.\n",

    "Customer service with ASOS is usually below par, but today I spoke with Ronette who dealt with my issue incredibly. I’m very happy, thank you.\n",
    "What does the CS check during first 4 min? Why do they ask if I'm still here? is it the check to get rid of customers? also why do I have to do all the job for them: provide the link of the return, the tracker, tell them which item I've returned. Why is it not automatic?\n",
    "Overall the CS is polite but this is not the first time I have to check on the team to get the money of the refund...\n",

    "Lots of patience. Dealt with my complicated issue really well. Thanks a bunch\n",
    "If 0 were possible here it is what is deserved. Ordered on 26th of November for a party on dec 6th . After I contacted asos it was “followed up” but the Item didn’t arrive until dec 12th. Returned on 15th as had no use for it any longer. Dec 28th “ they have received it back but haven’t processed it in the warehouse yet” I have to wait until dec 31st when I have to contact them again myself to ask for a manual refund if it has been processed. WTH !!! That is 36 days from order to processing which can then take 10 days to show a refund. Are you having a laugh ASOS .. it’s 2022!!!  I sell clothing online and Anpost delivers next day around Ireland if I have a return it’s back to me next day following return date and I refund immediately. Shocking customer care from a company, just shocking.. NEVER again!!! Account will be closed as soon as I receive my refund . Staff in customer service are nice but obviously very limited in how they are allowed to care for customers.. done!\n",
    "I’d rather give no stars.\n",
    "After not delivering my order, they then questioned me at length claiming it had been delivered. I have camera footage of my property, proving it was not there at the time they claimed yet they still proceed to “investigate” whilst refusing to send another or refund me.\n",

    "Re: ASOS and EVRI - Bedfellows responsible for a Customer Strained Relationship?\n",
    "\n",
    "ASOS continue to use Evri - the bottom-of-the-table delivery service in the whole of the UK. Furthermore, when items are missing of delivery or when deliveries seem to always be stalled - without any update for weeks upon weeks - there is no UK customers service/managers to 'put things right'. Instead, we have to type it up for people outside of the UK. This will never win my confidence!!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever tried to use the Voice Recognition service for Evri, you will know that it does not acknowledge the \"letters\" you voice for the tracking number. Is this deliberate? I think so. Poor, poor and poor!\n",
    "\n",
    "ASOS has decided to be bedfellows with this POOR and WEAKEST of delivery services. Should ASOS, therefore, be considered as not CARING for its OWN CUSTOMERS?\n",
    "\n",
    "PS: I only just got a REFUND today - 28 December 2022. In addition, I dare not re-Order these items as ASOS has yet to show an understanding for the importance of business relationships with customers by REASSURING said customers about whether delivery services with EVRI has improved(?). ASOS, therefore, seems willing to allow customers to go through this appalling EVRI delivery service again and again and again. Shameful!!\n",

When you are told a failed order has been reprocessed, they are saying that before it actually has. Two customer service representatives had to admit the previous person had lied.\n",
    "For almost 5 weeks I have been told by the rep they will personally take care of this and as a customer themselves they understand fully - they all say this exact wording. It is not true, and when I am told I will hear from someone I never do. If the order fails, the only way you find out is by chasing once again. This is now the sixth failure, the presents missed Christmas, but the worst part is the lies by customer service.\n",
    "I feel sorry for them as I know they are following a template put out by ASOS, but it means I can never use this company again.\n",

And now after almost 2 weeks , they are still asking me to wait an additional 10 days as they cannot locate the order . Order placed on 15th December, I am being asked to wait until 3rd January . I have requested a refund multiple time , they refused . I have asked to raise a complaint , they refused . The order was a Christmas present for my husband. They could have sent a replacement or refund so I can purchase something else . Obviously they have some communication issues with the courier but the customer is being penalised\n",

    "Disappointed with the service received over the past 2 weeks. A parcel been sat at an Evri depo since last Tuesday and supposed to be delivered by Christmas Eve, which it wasn’t. Contacted ASOS that evening, to be told it will be delivered that day (despite contacting them at 7pm) to then be told wait until the 27th and contact again for support. Contacted today which the live chat is completely pointless with script answers and not actually listening to the problems. All I ask now is to cancel and refund the order but can’t do that. Told it will be delivered today and wait for my tracking information. Now told to be delivered tomorrow and to contact them again for support.\n",
    "Disgusted, can’t give a phone or email to customer service won’t put you through to anyone senior. One agent even disconnected the chat with me as obviously had enough (no reason to disconnect the chat as pleasant enough just frustrated by not understanding and copy and pasting answers). I understand not completely ASOS fault but duty of care to use a reliable courier which isn’t happening. Also contact Evri although not expecting much from them either.\n",

Was told they don’t do good will gestures then sent an email to prove I had got one in the past. Literally only wanted £8 credit to purchase replacement for item that was damaged, only willing to offer promo code which they do every week anyway. Was a total frustrating mess of a conversation - wouldn’t recommend ordering make up off asos as they don’t package it safely for transit. And avoid contacting their customer service team at all costs, I was slowly losing the will to live!\n",

    "I only ever had two bad experiences whilst using ASOS for over 10 years. Both times at the hands of EVRI. I don’t accept that they’re stretched at Xmas. It’s didn’t sneak up on them & catch them by surprise. They are just incompetent at the one service they are supposed to provide. They supplied a fake photo as ‘proof’ of delivery. They also provided the EXACT same photo to a friend to cover for his parcel also being missing.\n",
    "That’s clearly fraud because they’re now accepting that it’s lost in transit. So was it delivered to the patch of grass in the photo with two white pipes or was it never even on the van to be delivered? I can of course back this up with evidence if requested.\n",
    "I’m reevaluating how much I really need to use ASOS anymore. Certainly as long as they continue their relationship with EVRI. You only need to search EVRI on twitter to see just how many complaints there are about the exact same thing. I hope whichever watchdog oversees this industry are looking into the performance of EVRI over the last 6 months & especially in December.\n",

If I had known this was a new cover up name for the dreaded 'hermes' delivery i would never have ordered through yourselves. I will  undoubtedly never see these parcels and would like you to know, I will not order from you again, so long as you use this disgraceful company. I know its a busy time of year, but why say you can offer a service to get people to order from you, when you know it is unachievable. Please keep the parcels, i dont wish to have anything to do with affiliates of my hermes or Evri!!  Re credit my acct and let me know the order is cancelled.\n",
    "First time ordered from Asos and the last time. Placed an order on 20th Dec for delivery for 22nd Dec for Xmas present. Got notification on 23rd so one day later that apparently delivered by Evri courier. Never got the parcel and the Evri driver who marked as delivered simply stole it as I even don't have his attempt on my cctv at this time. Contacted Asos, asked to wait, not sure why as this parcel will never be found. So no money, no Xmas present. Not sure why Asos uses the worst courier company like Evri.\n",

    "On the 22nd of December I ordered shoes for New Year's with next day delivery. I could sense they would be late because of Christmas, but not this late. The delivery dates keep changing in UPS yet the ASOS status says delivered. I contacted the online customer services. Unfortunately there is no calling available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer services lack personality and qualitative conversations because there is only online contact available. At first I had the feeling I was talking to a robot sending pre-generated messages. Also through message there is a bigger chance of miscommunication.\n",
    "As said in the messages: I'll be notified if anything changes on my refund and on my delivery I can only hope that there'll be anything done with this case and that I receive my refund on Premier and have my shoes delivered in time. At the end ASOS failed to comply with the purchase agreement of next day delivery/ Premier. My case: ASOS status sais delivered still today. Yet original date of delivery on UPS 23-12-2022, nothing; that changed to 27-12-2022.\n",

    "Having ordered two pairs of jeans for next day delivery from ASOS due for the 21/12/2022, despite taking the next day delivery payment, ASOS failed to deliver the jeans and has refused to refund my money.\n",
    "On the 21/12/2022 they instructed that next day delivery could be up to 10pm and if it hadn’t arrived by that time to contact them. At 3am on 22/12/2022 ASOS were contacted as the jeans had not been delivered and a refund was sought. It transpired that ASOS’s courier took a picture of a parcel and this required investigation. Irrespective of the Consumer Rights Act s28 and s29 that explicitly explain that delivery must be to the buyer, ASOS believes themselves to be above the law and refused to refund me for a parcel that only the courier had seen. Asos then asked for two days to investigate. They had this, but again refused to refund my money. Despite explaining that the items were no longer wanted - the person to whom these would have been a gift has left the country and we are on holiday - ASOS insists that they require more time to deliver. Irrespective of telling them that nobody would be in they insisted that they couldn’t refund until after the 26/12/2022. 26/12/2022 came and went, no refund. Asos has now written to say that they can deliver by the 03/01/2023 despite my saying that it is too late and nobody will be home. Again, they want me to contact them on the 04/12/2022 if delivery is not made whilst they retain my money which they refuse to refund despite their continuing breach of the terms of sale.\n",
    "DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS RIPOFF COMPANY. THEY DONT DELIVER, REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND WILL RETAIN YOUR MONEY WHEN THEY FAIL TO DELIVER YOUR ORDER.\n",
    "Mazen was very helpful and efficient. My issue was dealt with very quickly.\n",
    "This was the fourth time I had contacted Asos customer care about the same issue so I had become very frustrated but it was resolved straightaway.\n",
    "I had found some of the advisors unhelpful and actions they had claimed to have carried out were not actually true but this time it was solved in a matter of minutes.\n",
    "One previous advisor kept me online for over an hour and refused to provide me with details for me to complain about the service I had received.\n",

    "My experience with ASOS consultants is always great. They are all very nice and always try to help. I appreciate it a lot especially in such a busy period like now right after Christmas.\n",
    "Absolutely disgraceful! Do not order from this company! They process your order and then do not send the items out and leave you having to chase them for your money back. They say they will raise investigations but do not and they still owe me over £60. Absolutely disgusting company!\n",
    "Received faulty item, returned it back! was delivered to the warehouse month ago and still did not get a refund. The customer service representatives are unhelpful and aunprofessional\n",

    "I’ve used Asos for a number of yrs , I’ve paid for the next day delivery service too which hasn’t actually delivered any thing next day now to me in over 3 yrs. two orders placed in December took over 4 days to arrive. Clothes have also gotten cheaper in quality too over the last few yrs, while I like the offers they have on threadbare clothing their own asos design clothing is poorly made.\n",
    "Grandson placed an order Dec 9 & also paid for next day delivery for Xmas gifts. Still no order received despite repeated update requests. Online agent now says need to wait another 3 days for investigation to be carried out. Extremely poor service.still no sign of order or refund. Worst experience ever from a company who has no structure to deal with problems. STAY WELL AWAY from ASOS\n",
    "They were really nice, helpful. Working really fast and asked about my day. Worked fast with my refund, i recommend if there is any issues! 😊\n",
    "The customer service is dang good!! I chatted with an employee to help me with my refund that was on hold. She or he, not sure,  arranged everything so quickly and answerd all my questions (had to change the payment methode for the refund an didn't now how). She/he was patient and did everything right away.\n",

    "Horrilble customer service…. Received a Christmas gift and it was too small, now have to purchase it again at a higher price because that’s their policy… not purchasing from ASOS again!!!!!\n",

    "I purchased a £100 gift card on 22/12/2022, was advised an email with activation link would be sent on 23/12/2022. No email received by 23rd so I contacted ASOS via live chat on 24/12 which proved to be a waste of time. ASOS had taken the money for the gift card, not sent it and then blocked my account. They could not tell me how long the “investigation” into why my account had been blocked would take nor could they tell me if/when I would receive my gift card I paid for! Had to explain to a family member why they had no present Christmas Day. Whole point of e-gift vouchers as easier/smoother/quicker process. Absolutely did not prove to be the case with ASOS! I also contacted ASOS via live chat today 26/12 again to be told - “it’s being investigated, we can’t help no more” no time frame, nothing. Appalling experience from ASOS! Lucky I screenshot the order as had I not, I would have had no order confirmation number or anything, just disgusting! Didn’t even get an email from ASOS to “warn” me of “suspicious activity” or my account being blocked.\n",
    "Have been using Asos for a long time. They use to do next day delivery with no cut off but now there is a cut off. There premium delivery feature is why i keep using them. I can order and return free of charge. However i do think they need to improve their product lines with more brands. Their customer service is amazing too. Cant really fault them apart from the delivery but its understandable.\n",
    "Lovely advisor helped me process a return\n",
    "There was an issue with a return as it wouldn’t let me, but the chat was helpful and quick and resolved the issue right away\n",
    "Very helpful and prompt.  Thanks to Jonathan for helping through my problem.\n",

    "Ordered several shirts and a couple gym shorts for Christmas. Everything arrived quickly and with enough time to wrap as gifts! There’s so much to choose from on the app that I have a hard time deciding. Not only that, there’s always a good sale running. You can’t beat the multi-packs either. I’ve purchased several of the multi colored ASOS branded 5 packs of shirts over the years and they’ve been great. I don’t love flashy graphic tees, so these are my go-to shirts! Highly recommend the ASOS app for clothes or shoe shopping\n",

    "For my most recent order they delayed the parcel undeliverable due to weather conditions 10th, proceeded to show that same notification for the next two weeks and then updated the delivery tracking to have been delivered on the 10th December. No evidence or message was provided regarding the delivery of the parcel such as photos or delivery to neighbor. Caused me inconvenience and It's annoying. The compensation they gave was not satisfying to say the least for the inconvenience I was provided.\n",

    "Ordered a package over a month ago, never got delivered but was sent back to ASOS it seems. No communication ever since, impossible to reach customer support, so no idea if they will send the package again at some point or will I get my money back? How do you contact customer care if the chat does not connect for a month now, trying also social media, is there a known email?\n",

    "\n",
    "So far Asos have offered to refund the next day delivery fee but this in no way makes up for the lack of Christmas presents. Customer service is useless. Thoroughly disappointed by my first (and likely last ever) experience of shopping with Asos.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generally avoid shopping with any retailer that uses Hermes/Evri for deliveries as we have had so many packages go missing over the past few years. A rebrand to Evri does not solve anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be asking Asos to resend the items after Christmas by another courier company and give a full refund.\n",
    "Very helpful and quick and replying. Also made the problem understanding\n",
    "Like everyone else, will never order with ASOS again because they use Evri. Lost original parcel, then wouldn't offer full replacement as we had one item in black Friday sale and the price had since doubled, very shady...so got got half replacement but this package also lost! It's made more difficult because the tracking is wrong and states it's with courier and will attempt to deliver....then no change for over 10 days, so trying to explain that to agents on a chat who have little command of English is a nightmare. ASOS don't want to refund no matter what you can prove about not receiving your parcel. If I see Evri as the courier for any business I will now go elsewhere.\n",

    "The representative I spoke to was very helpful! They resolved my issue and it was a great experience.\n",
    "The customer care service was able to facilitate a return and a refund for me for a product that I didn't really like from the moment I received the order.\n",
    "What has happened to ASOS? Having been a customer for a long time and had great service to been on the receiving end the past few months of some simply shocking episodes. The most recent an order placed on 14/12 with next day delivery due through premier delivery. Well as you have probably guessed asos decided to send this via EVRI so even now as I write this review (24/12) the parcel has not arrived. Spoke to asos through their chat system and was told on 20/12 that a message would be sent to EVRI to chase up my parcel and if I hadn’t heard anything by 22/12 to contact them back and either a refund or replacement would be issued. Nothing received so on the 23/12 I contacted asos again however this time was told I had to leave it until cob that day and to contact them on 24/12 if no update received and again I would be either given a refund of replacement. I contacted the online chat again today and was told I now need to leave it until 01/01/2023 and if the parcel doesn’t arrive I can then contact asos and they will arrange a refund. So basically I have to wait 18 days before I can be given a refund on the off chance that EVRI decide to deliver my parcel. Apparently you cannot log a complaint through asos despite the website saying to contact the chat facility to log a complaint and the colleagues on the chat might as well just not answer as it’s utterly useless. I’ve ended up requesting a chargeback through my bank so I would expect asos to be receiving notification of this shortly. If anyone from asos is reading these reviews then I would advise that some major changes need to be made as from\n",
    "What I have been seeing you are loosing customers through the sheer lack of customer service at a rate of knots.\n",
    "Great information supplied and very quick and polite responses. The solution was perfectly suited.\n",
    "I ordered some Christmas presents for my daughter in 11th December. As they did not arrive on time I requested a refund which took a number of messages to ASOS before it was agreed and finally received. The parcel eventually arrived on Christmas Eve. As an honest person I immediately contacted ASOS and said I was pleased it had arrived in time for Christmas and could I now please pay. The only option I was told was to return the items. I explained I didn’t want to return the items I wanted to keep them and just pay for them. After a long conversation with ‘customer care’ including being told I could reorder with next day delivery and still get them for Christmas! To which I did ask them if they were in fact Santa Claus! Since it took more than 2 weeks to get the delivery I suggested this perhaps might not happen and I would like to give my daughter her presents on Christmas Day. I offered to pay several times and was threatened that if I did not return the items then my future refunds would be impacted. I would NEVER use ASOS again. Be warned!!\n",
    "I felt claimed down and positive  that my issue will  be resolved i was quite  upset  but Angelu was perfect with handling  my disappointment. Hopefully  this matter will be resolved\n",
    "Great customer service agent, was very responsive and helpful\n",
    "The worst customer service I have ever  received. Out of pocket before Christmas and account blocked. I ordered parcels which came in two separate delivery’s the first one I had items arrive with a jacket which was missing. Then parcel 2 had the correct item but wrong colour. Because I highlighted the jacket being missing they terminated my account. I used the online chat to find out what was happening and to change the polo t shirt for the correct colour so it would be here for Christmas. I have been fobbed off and told not to use ASOS again. I’m £160 out of pocket due to no jacket arriving  and a t shirt the wrong colour. I can no longer contact them about the matter.\n",
    "Friendly and helpful, sorted out an incorrect return for me! Remade a label and emailed it to me!\n",

I was told rest assured the package would arrive within 2 working days. I have now not received the package and I am now advised that it will arrive in 10 working days meaning I am without a Christmas present for a loved one and now need to go out shopping on Christmas Eve.

    "Evri has not delivered a single of my Christmas parcels.. they are all lost .. isn’t that strange?

Customer service at asos aren’t helpful in the slightest.\n",
    "Mary was quick and efficient with investigating my concern and provided a solution if it wasn’t able to be fixed\n",
    "Janine helped me figure out what happened to my refund\n",
    "Rhenzza Made the process easy and fast. Very helpful.\n",
    "Although I'm disappointed that my parcel hasn't yet arrived with the courier, the Asos customer service agent was very helpful in updating me and raising a query and offering a replacement or refund should the shipment be lost or further delayed.\n",
    "great company, great customer service\n",
    "Listened to my issues and solved it for me. I am satisfied.\n",
    "Very friendly, fast and efficient customer service.\n",
    "Kyla was so helpful - lovely kind person with the patience of a saint!\n",
    "I love asos. It has a great range of clothes for all body types and I can always find nice clothes on there. My only issue is that a lot of clothes are often sold out. But that doesn’t always affect me. :)\n",
    "Awful customer services. Like what other people have been saying, they keep making you wait. I’ve asked for a refund and kept getting asked to wait further 48 hours before they can process anything. I’ve paid for premier delivery too which they can’t fulfil because they keep using Evri as a courier service! Kept having to chase up their customer services- might as well have talked to a bot as they just kept going round in circles. Avoid at all costs! Don’t pay for premier delivery, you probably wont get your delivery on time anyway!\n",
    "I ordered for the first time from this company and the prices are great and fine and what not, but a little promo for first time purchase would have been nice. My order was over $100. Usually stores give you a little something for your first time shopping experience, but ASOS is not about that I guess. My order was originally $200, none of the items on sale, but when I got to  the checkout and I noticed no promo and I HAD MAKE AN ACCOUNT with them just to place my order, I removed some items because I was a bit tilted by that. It's my first time ordering from here, I don't even know if what I got will fit me correctly since a I'm 6'1 female, so it was a bit discouraging. They took the time to promote their \"membership\" for $25 a year though.\n",
    "Alfie was very polite and helpful and guided me through into retrieving my account very quick!\n",
    "The customer care agent was exceptional - really helpful and wonderful to talk to!\n",
    "Good feedback, was clear and helpful\n",
    "so cute, he helped me a lot, unfortunately my problem didn’t solve, but i anyway noble\n",
    "Nice chat, help was provided. Thanks!\n",
    "Fast response, nice\n",
    "Good attitude, and helpful\n",
    "Literally everything went wrong, from the communication about my order that i never recieved because asos send it back without giving me any notice. To the incorrect refunded amount which i had to prove with screenshots because they didn't believe me. The whole service is just wrong when it comes to treating their costumers.\n",
    "I ordered a coat for my daughter’s Xmas present and ASOS used Yodel as the courier. Yodel said they’d delivered it through the letter box on 14th December, which is a blatant lie. I raised a complaint with ASOS on 16th December and they said they’d investigate with Yodel and let me know within 1 day. I didn’t hear anything back from ASOS so assumed it had been sent again but when I chased ASOS they said Yodel had said they’d delivered it but I could get a refund or they could send again. Why wasn’t I notified immediately so I could contest Yodel’s lies? So I’ve basically wasted a week and it’s now 23rd December and I won’t get the coat in time for Christmas. You can’t speak to anyone on the phone at ASOS and the people on the chat function don’t do what they say you will. I advise you to keep a record of any chat you have with them. Absolutely shambolic customer service.\n",
    "I placed my order over 2 weeks ago & advised ASOS via their farcical chat service on the 19th of December, that I still hadn't received my order, despite the fact that I was supposed to receive it the next day! As the recipient of the gift was due to leave on the afternoon of the 21st of December to go back home to America, I advised ASOS (on the 19th of December), that if I was not in receipt of my order by the morning of the 21st, I wanted the order cancelled & my money refunded.\n",
    "However, despite responding to an e-mail from ASOS on the 21st of December, in which I was advised that the courier company (Evri) wanted me to wait an additional 10 days(!) for them to locate my order, I responded to ASOS with an unequivocal no & requested an immediate full refund. 2 days later no response from! It is only today (the 23rd), following corresponding via their chat service & making the threat of a formal complaint to the FCA if my money wasn't refunded immediately & not in 2023 (which was how long they were expecting me to wait!), did I subsequently 10 minutes later, receive confirmation that my money is being refunded back to me (thank God I paid using PayPal!). I strongly suggest that ASOS use another courier company, as EVRI's service is & always has been diabolical & clearly no amount of rebranding (they were previously called Hermes) is going to change that!\n",
    "Would give 0 stars if I could!!\n",
    "Cocked up my order (which was a Christmas present) and sent it to me a day before Christmas Eve 😡🤬!!\n",
    "Missing parcel, was told need to wait 2 days for evri to investigate…. As you will see in the chat 2 days in my counting was today only to be told it would be the end off today, no further forward with advisor and as of yet nothing resolved or any updates\n",
    "I ordered a coat on Thursday 15th December and paid for next day delivery, when the item failed to turn up by the Monday (3 days later) I tried to contact customer service, they don’t make that process easy - presumably on purpose. On Monday I spoke to someone via webchat who said I needed to wait till tomorrow, if it still didn’t arrive they’d process a refund. Tuesday I joined the awful webchat again, this time I was told to wait until midnight. Wednesday joined the webchat again and this time I was told they’ve raised it with Evri and to give them 2 working days. Friday I joined webchat again and this time I was told I need to wait 10days, I’ve already waited 7 by the point. I paid next day delivery which I was then told is not guaranteed - why have it as an option then! It was a £30 coat and £10 delivery, all this for the sake of £40! It’s now the principal as I refuse to be scammed. Just refund the money, hire competent staff and take it up with evri. Whole experience has been horrendous.\n",
    "Really bad, item didnt even leave the warehouse and they wasnt going to tell me. Dont trust now and will never use again.\n",
    "Had the pleasure of dealing with Janus today who was so helpful and processed a return for me within minutes.\n",
    "Really appreciate the quick and friendly help. Absolute 5 stars 😊\n",
    "The agent was great! Showed empathy and had a great tone of voice\n",
    "Very terrible customer advisor name Mahmood. The way he/she ended the the customer service chat was very rude. I asked a question and he simply chose to just round off the conversation and closed the chat. He/she did not even ask do I need help with anything else” as would normally be asked.\n",
    "Easy, fast and stress free!\n",
    "John was very understanding and lovely. Sorted my issues in 2 mins.\n",
    "Where’s my delivery? Evri inaccessible, sorry to my daughter, no Christmas present for you this year\n",
    "I vow to never use ASOS again, horrendous Customer Service, really have been given the run around.  I ordered on the 7th December for a 10th December delivery.  Nothing arrived contacted via the chat line several times, emails and chat line as only way to chase an order.  Told they were sure it would arrive before Christmas.  23rd December nothing arrived, contacted the Chat Line and told by Shashank that I would not get a refund until the 26th as I had to wait a full 10 days and the original order was placed on the 7th.  I explained that the order has not arrived prior to Christmas and it is a gift,I would like a refund today and he said there would be no refund until the 26th.  Totally wrong, how can customer service be so poor.  Do not recommend ASOS avoid if possible.\n",
    "Janus was quick to respond and was a great help in answering my question. A super easy and pleasant chat with Asos' customer support.\n",
    "Alliah was very polite, friendly and quick to respond\n",
    "Dan was promt and attentive with my problem.\n",
    "Customer service was quick, polite and effective. Solved my problem in no time.\n",
    "I have ordered from Asos i lot of times, always a great experience! This time i ordered a sweat set, but only recieved the sweatshirt! But after five minutes in touch with customer service they sent a new set, such good service! Very happy!\n",
    "Adam was very helpful today. I received the wrong size in crocs which can happen. But I got refunded before I returned it which was very nice. Give this advisor a pay rise 👍🏼\n",
    "Great help from Mary online who has reprocessed my order after Evri lost it. Will HOPEFULLY arrive tmrw - Xmas Eve - so fingers crossed!\n",
    "Great team\n",
    "Fast\n",
    "Easy contact\n",
    "Kind, Quick answer, No delay.\n",
    "I have had zero problems with asos ever, but this one specific time i ordered jeans and crystals for my teenage daughter for christmas. I received the parcel and it was very clear that it had been ripped open by someone and very badly taped up!!\n",
    "Then i realised i was missing the crystals from the parcel, im guessing some greedy person stole them?! It would make sense with the way the parcel was so damaged and selotaped up.\n",
    "I spoke to a lovely person on asos live chat and they were so helpful and kind on the matter. They ordered the crystals again for me, no problem at all. This person is a credit to your team!\n",
    "Because the person that was helping me dealt my issue very well\n",
    "Issue was dealt with so quickly by ‘PreciousJade’, thank you !\n",
    "Nelson was really helpful and kept me up to date all the way through.\n",
    "I would have given zero stars if possible. Ordered for next day delivery and the item isn’t here 10 days later. Told to wait 48 hours for delivery, then another 72 hours, and now another 24. Refusing to issue a refund or replacement despite the tracking information not being updated for 10 days.\n",
    "Shocking service been waiting a week for delivery to be getting told every day it will be here tomorrow\n",
    "Jolo was so helpful - my parcel was literally with me before we ended the chat\n",
    "the most helpful staff by far\n",
    "Promised a refund 10+ times over the course of 6 weeks. No refund and no items ever arrived. Awful customer service with no escalation procedure for issues (no number to call or email address). Blatant theft - taking money for items never provided.\n",
    "The representative was quick and attentive. I had a question about a return and they were able to help. I received a new return slip within minutes.\n",
    "Rhenzza was very friendly and obviously great at their job. They were so helpful.\n",
    "ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING!!!!!!!!!\n",
    "THEY MAKE THEIR CUSTOMERS CHASING THEIR ORDERS, THEY PLAY WITH CUSTOMERS.. AFTER THE ORDER NOT BEING DELIVERED THEY SAY WAIT 2 DAYS THEN ANOTHER 2 DAYS AND HE PROMISED I WILL HAVE MY REFUND AFTER THE SECOND 2 DAYS!!! AND NOW THEY SAY WAIT ANOTHER 4 DAYS FOR REDUND TO BE PROCESSED!!! JUST SHOCKING!!!!!!\n",
    "Lenrimae & SarahLyn helped me with a refund as Evri lost my parcel which I order 2 weeks ago. Thank you both! lovely customer service.\n",
    "Great customer service. Issue with it getting delivered and my rep really helped me even gave me some tips\n",
    "John was so lovely and extremely calm and in-depth with his explanations (considering this stressful time of year). He made everything very clear for me to understand and was happy to re-explain and answer any further questions I had. He also took a personal interest in my day (which you dont get very often!)\n",
    "ASOS customer care is one of the best customer services I’ve ever had to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "They’re polite and get your issues sorted quickly and efficiently. Even when it’s the pesky Delivery company’s fault!\n",
    "\n",
    "Special thanks to Gilly for helping and being so lovely!\n",
    "Had a couple of bad experiences with customer service agents before not knowing what is going on or how to check my orders. However today i came across the best agent (Wasim) Ive seen so far. He was helpful and knew what he was doing.\n",
    "Bottom line, keep trying until you get to a good agent.\n",
    "Customer service is always helpful. BabyJeane was pleasant chatting with and assisted me with my concerns. She resolved everything within a short time.\n",
    "I used to be a regular customer, ordering from ASOS 2-3 times a year. But recent experiences have been disappointing. In my last order, two items arrived in the wrong size. When I attempted to return them, I discovered that I now have to cover the return costs. While this was a bit of a letdown, I decided to trust ASOS, given my years of being a loyal customer. Placed another order only to teceive all those items in the WRONG size again! Now, I have to go through the process of another return, and pay for it? I don't think I will be placing any more orders in the near future.\n",
    "Always excellent customer service but please stop using Royal Mail! I have a premier account with next day delivery but can’t rely on this anymore. It takes 2-3 days with Royal\n",
    "Mail after sending. They aren’t reliable.\n",
    "Nidhi was very helpful and supported with the query of my return. She was reassured me if there were any problems I could contact back. She was patient and kind.\n",
    "Shivan was brilliant, they sorted my issue straight away meaning minimal stress and not having to go around in circles for ages. Thank you!\n",
    "My delivery was just left outside on my slated front in the rain.  I received no confirmation that it has been delivered and I was away for the weekend. When I purchased the item, I did so on the basis that the Asos Returns page said that Christmas orders could be returned till 15 January.  When I opened my wet package, the delivery note stated that it should be returned within 28 days, which meant I could not keep it until Christmas.  I then had a very frustrating online chat session with customer services to try to clarify the contradictory advice given, but so far to no avail.  It is a shame, as the garment is just what I was looking for for my son.  Sadly, he now won't get it.\n",
    "I had an issue with a return and sought help with ASOS’ customer service team. I was put in touch with Preeti who was kindly able to rectify the issue for me quickly once I had explained my issue.\n",
    "Pretty much what the headline says - I ordered an item 4 days ago and I have a premiere account which offers 'unlimited free Next-day Delivery for a whole year'. My item still hasnt arrived, and when I spoke with the chat team they said \"I would like to inform you that we have changed the next day delivery to fastest delivery for temporary basis due to high volume of orders and it is temporary but It will be change to next day delivery soon in next couple of days.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So they can basically turn it off and on when they like, so literally you pay for a service and they change the terms of that service WITHOUT notifying you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Con.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I asked in the chat to escalate this complaint, the CSR Shubham made me wait 45 minutes and then told me to come back 'sometime' as no managers were available. TERRIBLE customer service.\n",
    "The easiest process, I was stressed about receiving my orders but they re ordered them no problem. Was quick and actually helpful\n",
    "Jagdish was a great help today. I had 3 issues I raised. Jagdish solved the issues and was a friendly team member. Its nice to have great interactions from ASOS.\n",
    "Great asset to your services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks again Jagdish\n",
    "I’d give zero review if I could! Ordered over £500 worth of clothes. Most didn’t arrive as Evri delivery man said parcel was damaged and he returned it. Two weeks later and over 3 hours text talking to customer care’ and nothing has been done! Items have not been refunded or replaced and less than a month before Xmas I cannot get my money back. It’s dreadful and I will NEVER order off them again!\n",
    "Their customer care is super accommodating and friendly. I just got one named Adrian. He was patient and helpful in processing my refund and entertaining my questions.\n",
    "Ankit was very helpful and communicates with calm. She was very sympathetic with the situation and find a solution to the problem.\n",
    "John was of amazing assistance and super quick to help me with my issue. Amazing service!\n",
    "Worst experience i've ever had shopping online, DO NOT SUPPORT ASOS, IT DOES NOT CARE ABOUT VALUED CUSTOMERS. The Website is buggy, codes run out whenever they want them to, you get kicked out off the website often, the prices are sometimes even more expensive than the original retail price which you could get on Amazon. At all costs, please avoid ASOS. Do not buy anything off them you will cost yourself unnecessary stress.\n",
    "Jonathan was absolutely great today !! He sorted my issues immediately. I big shout out for him for putting up with me😂😂.\n",
    "\n",
    "You seem like a keeper.\n",
    "Sent me wrong size, sent short instead of long jeans, although the sticker on the bag said long, when I measured inside leg it was short. Now I am worried I won't get a refund intime to buy my son the correct size for Christmas,  they also looked worn\n",
    "TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Run don’t walk from this website!!!!   They would not adjust my very first purchase using the “newbie” promo code because of glitch!  They lost many customers now over 10% off a purchase.\n",
    "Horrible service Placed the order on monday 27 nov.  It showed 3 working days for standard delivery so i went ahead. Later i the confirmation email had a different delivery date which i didnt check. No help from customer service\n",
    "Don't think I've ever encountered such shoddy and careless customer service. Ordered £300s worth of items for next day delivery and still no sign of my delivery. Asos stuck the blame on the carrier and had no updates for me, I had to continuously chase them and was repeatedly told my order would arrive the next day but here we are one week later and still nothing. I had to go out of my way to contact them constantly and ended up putting in another order. Lack of professionalism, urgency and empathy - happy to take your money though.\n",
    "Jason was very efficient, clear and quick with his communication and very helpful in resolving the issue of a missing item in my order.\n",
    "If you miss the rerun date with a day because you’re sick they will ask for a doctors note and say sorry can’t help you. 1 day! Things happen to everyone and there is no flexibility in what they do or try to support you as a customer. Now I have a brand new shoes too big to be used because I tried to return these 1 day too late! Definitely not using ASOS ever again.\n",
    "Blocked my account randomly with no explanation. I have been a loyal customer for over 10 years, ordering parcels at least 2/3 times a month since 2014. No email to let me know why it has been blocked and I have also paid repeatedly for premier delivery over the years, which now I do not have access to use. Very appalling customer service and disappointing! AVOID at all costs, customer care team unhelpful!!\n",
    "It’s not great initially trying to make contact but when I finally got to chat with someone, I was able to resolve my issue and the customer advisor was very polite and helpful.\n",
    "Don’t pay for premium. They send you mouldy clothes. Orders NEVER arrive on time and oh yeah they still use evri who are known for their rubbish standards and never deliver on time.\n",
    "ASOS returns policy needs to be updated so people aren’t set up! The policy states items can be returned within 28 days. It does not state this has to be full priced items and therefore easy to assume it is all. The next paragraph talks about returns from Hong Kong, then the paragraph after that talks about sale items. I am unable to return over $200 worth of items because I am outside the 14 day. I checked the returns policy and stopped reading at the first paragraph considering it didn’t state full priced only and the next paragraph talked about a different country so I didn’t scroll down. I’m so annoyed and upset with this. I request your policy be re-written to make it clear it is 28 days for full priced items and 14 for sale in the sale paragraph so other people don’t lose their money like I did. This experience plus having to pay for returns means that this once loyal customer is probably never going to shop with ASOS again.\n",
    "My order came very quickly and was left in my confirmed safe place as requested\n",
    "I have always been pleasantly surprised by the ASOS team - they have always helped resolve my issues - I usually get through quite quickly. I know if something has gone wrong with my order I can rely on them to help me out!\n",
    "Excellent service just don’t let your screen time out or you will be disconnected!!\n",
    "We our family are very old and loyal customer of asos . Recently they are scamming and doing unfair business. They started high brands which we buy a lot and our last orders we sent some return as size is very big . They audacity of asos mailed us we did not return properly . It mean we used it . This is new way to sell customers forcefully and it’s a proper scam and unfair trade . They cloth we never wore even tired not even a minute to see the fitting it’s very big but how dare they say they are sending us back .\n",
    "Customer service rep was polite and helpful, the initial problem was frustrating but they gave me the answers I needed and provided solutions.\n",
    "I have had a few bad experiences with Asos, recently I was given a faulty QR code that was already used so I was unable to return well within the returns period. I contacted them what turned out to be a few days after the returns period to ask for a new code, however they said because I had tried to use the code multiple times then it didn't work. Although it had never worked, and had I contacted them a few days earlier then they would have been able to help. Seems unfair considering I had tried multiple times to return, only to be told I couldn't because I reached out too late.\n",
    "I have also had issues with missing parcels and quality of items in the past.\n",
    "Fast and effective. I hadn't received a refund payment. Support solved the problem within minutes.\n",
    "Closed my account for no reason, with no warning and have told me they will never read my emails regarding this again. 0 stars but sadly they get more than they deserve by default.\n",
    "I have bought from ASOS for years, I love the selection and the sizing, the quick delivery, everything works for me. Recently I bought the biggest order I've ever made worth £350 in time for a weekend away I was going on. The order arrives and I'm missing 3 pairs of shoes, but I try everything else on and decide I like the necklace I ordered, but the other shoes and clothes I picked didn't suit me, and I intended to send them back as per my statutory rights. I report the missing shoes with ASOS customer care, who apologize and ask whether I want a refund or a replacement, to which I ask for a refund. My request is passed to their specialist team, who send me an email 10 hours later to say that my account has been blocked for suspicious activity?? So just because I made a big order and didn't receive some of it, I now cannot return items I tried on and never wore. Please unblock my account so I can return items I am entitled to return!!\n",
    "I’ve had a problem with my next day delivery process and Rhyniella helped me! She was so polite and patient and helped so quickly! :)\n",
    "I ordered an item on 19th November, still waiting for my item to be delivered. I've been back and forth with Asos and Royal Mail like a yoyo but getting nowhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried again with Royal Mail and waited over 1 hour to get no response at all. I can't even get through to Asos now to get a full refund. Despite them taking my money, this is customer service in 2023, as all you do is talk to a f@£ing computer!!!\n",
    "I ordered during the Blackfriday with evri as the corporate of drivers who are thieves. I do have a next day delivery after one week and having to wait for evri investigation asos still demands you wait an extra few days for them to investigate. I was the one to contact evri to investigate. After evri notified me that the parcel is definitely missing to let asos know asos then said we too need to investigate! Customer serivce don’t exist!\n",
    "Customer service was very helpful and quick to solve my problem. The only thing I would say is including pictures seemed quite difficult but apart from that, amazing.\n",
    "Guys, never purchase from ASOS. I've encountered numerous issues with the chat feature on the app. This marks the final occasion I will be using ASOS. Despite engaging with several chat representatives over the past 7 days, no resolution has been achieved. Each time, I was told to wait for a resolution within 48 hours, but the issue persists. So ASOS practically never gave me my items, took y money and i cannot contact anyone for support or email or call. The app is not helping and the customer service through the app is constantly lying and i have screenshots to prove it. DONT PURCHASE FROM THEM\n",
    "Vikas was incredibly quick and helpful - my issue was addressed instantly. Thank you\n",
    "Terrible customer service on chat line - manned by people who have no idea what they are doing - informed by 'Haneeh' that ASOS Prime delivery only applies for orders UNDER £15.00!  ASOS's lack of customer focus now is appalling - no way to email or contact anybody by phone.  Saving money by outsourcing and customers are affected - I will not be using ASOS in the future.\n",
    "Very polite customer service rep - Hamanshi - resolved quality issue very promptly and smoothly. Thank you\n",
    "Very poor experience when having to return shoes due to them falling apart only 2-3 months after buying. In the end I returned the shoes twice, did not receive a refund and did not get my shoes back either. Multiple chats with agents over a few months got me nowhere. Very disappointed.\n",
    "Lewis is a total gem! He gave me exactly what I asked for with no complaints and made my experience fast and easy. He is a complete professional and clearly a credit to the company!\n",
    "BUYER BEWARE! Read the return policy carefully.  If your not sure about the size, then order 2 of different sizes. Customer service is lacking and no phone number.  Just a chat online. Not very good customer support at all. I had ordered 2 expensive jackets by thier size chart and they were to big. So I have to return those then order the other ones in the correct size separately. They were then more money than what I paid for originally.  Buyer be warned.\n",
    "Great until you need to speak to someone. The customer service on the live chat is terrible and not worth the bother. They sent me the wrong size twice, after an hour on live chat trying to sort it out with vague, rude responses and poor English, I will now just return for a refund and buy the item elsewhere.\n",
    "I ordered a jacket on sale for 600kr. They cancelled the order without warning and increases the price of the jacket on site to 1000kr.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I tried to contact support , I only got to talk to an AI assistant that were to no help. Never buying anything there again.\n",
    "AWFUL!!\n",
    "Registered a £400 return and took it to the drop off point twice and the labels didnt work. Contacted customer services and now because the 28 days returns days have passed, they cant raise another reutrn, even though the return was registered on time and tried to return on time but THEIR label didnt work. Customer service was absolutely shocking and worst I have expereinced in a long time, with absoultey no attempt to try and resolve the situation other than copied and pasted messages and broken english. Wont ever use asos again and will warn others not to as well.\n",
    "I am from Italy. I bought a dress on sale. I wanted to return it and I discovered I couldn't do it because they changed the return policy and instead of writing it on the returns page they write it at the bottom of the order confirmation email. And so I lost my money. Thank you Asos!\n",
    "Will not buy again....\n",
    "I recieved an explanation of everything that was happening so I was never waiting without knowing what was going on. I was offered multiple solutions to my problem and a very kind treatment through all the process.\n",
    "jonathan was very helpful and polite. he helped me right away and gave me the option to replace or refund my faulty item without needing to return it.\n",
    "Seeing the next day delivery option, I decided to order a new outfit for an engagement party which was in 2 days time. I spent a good hour or so looking through the website and picked out an outfit for the party as well as some more clothes I liked. I ordered well within the cut off time for next day delivery (over 4 hours remaining) and signed up for an account to track my order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approx 4 hours later I get an email to say my order has now been cancelled (at at time in which it’s too late to order from anywhere else) due to suspicious activity on my account. I have no idea why this has happened, I have never had issues ordering online prior. I then tried to log in to see if I had enough time to reorder; account locked due to suspicious activity. No email or phone number or any reasonable way to contact asos, just a web chat. This web chat was quite useless and basically said a team will get in touch after investigating. I am now clearly not going to receive my order within the time I need it, and the refund will take up to 10 working days to come back into my account so I actually can’t afford to go elsewhere.\n",
    "Honestly do not use ASOS, I usually use the NEXT app and website which is fantastic and ever so reliable, if looking for occasion wear.\n",

    "The worst experience ever I placed an order 7 months ago and they canceled the order I didn’t receive the order and they didn’t return my money back .. I tried to contact the costumer service but no way they can’t help .. I need my money back !!!\n",
    "AWFUL! I ordered some clothes for my holiday and signed up and paid extra for Premier Delivery as I needed them next day. Order placed on the 11th October and the package did not arrive until the 14th (when I had already left to go away - not a great start) I tried to return the items when I got back (within the 28 days from when the package arrived but out of the 28 days from when the order was placed) I explained all of this to customer services and the person I spoke to said she agreed with me that this wasn't acceptable but the system would not allow her to process the refund. ASOS are allowed to deliver the package late with no penalties but if I try to do the same it's a different story of course. With regards to the premier delivery, I have been told I can have a 'refund' on that but I will not have premier access anymore so that's a waste of time. I spoke for over an hour and got absolutely nowhere. I refuse to believe that a company as big as ASOS has no way of processing a refund other than the standard process on the system.\n",
    "Do not pay for next day delivery\n",
    "Do not pay premium service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because\n",
    "You will not get your parcels next day or even the day after or even the day after that either.\n",
    "As for premium service, there are no perks at all, neither would you get your parcels expedited.\n",
    "\n",
    "And please note that you may occasionally get returned, used smelly goods because there are loads of scammers, many of them who are complaining here. (I have rarely returned anything until now despite 10-15 years of loyalty and 1000s worth of goods)\n",
    "\n",
    "Today I write purely due to frustration of not receiving goods on time, this time because I needed them to visit friends and family with my xmas gifts starting this weekend and I have nothing and it has majorly upset me.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to be fair, ASOS is good overall in that I normally don't have many problems. I also tolerate some returned and used goods. I however have a smelly shirt in my last purchase which was addressed adequately and swiftly for me, But they need to justify next day delivery and premier membership and honor delivery dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "And chat service is exceptionally poor. Thank fully they can manage English. But they just tell you what you already know. They will not help you with more details or expediting delivery etc. In fact they do nothing but read out your order details. It is sad that ASOS is paying for these chatterboxes who are misfit for purpose.\n",
    "Shame I can't rate 0. Customer service team on chat think it's acceptable to end a chat and another thinks it's acceptable to just stop responding. They refused to put me through to a Manager or PayPal Manager. PayPal and my bank both say ASOS is at fault and needs to cancel the transaction within their PayPal, but they don't want to acknowledge it.\n",
    "Currently £80 down with an order that didn't complete. Disgraceful and I will be shouting this from the rooftops!!\n",
    "Warning anybody purchasing from ASOS this Christmas.\n",
    "I received incorrect goods. Contacted ASOS they have refused to send me the goods I ordered. I have had to return the incorrect goods they sent and will have to wait 10 working days for refund.\n",
    "Terrible customer service\n",
    "Customer service is always an absolute 10/10 experience I was Cathrine to Karla and she was superb sweet and helpful and helped me figure out my issues very quickly.\n",
    "Ordered 2 pairs of NB trainers, sizes 6.5 and 7 as unsure which size would fit. Returned the 6.5 as too small, perfect condition and well packaged for the return. Used their returns corrier Evri, received email confirmation of receipt then nothing for 3 weeks. Chased them up to be told the returned item was in an unacceptable condition (absolutely untrue) and the item had been returned to me (also untrue). Their online chat was painfully slow 1 hour, 20mins, and a total waste of time. For the last 30 mins transferred to a manager, equally slow and useless, only able to tell me they would email an update, I'm not holding my breath.\n",
    "HOLY ****\n",
    "i placed an order (because i forgot i wouldn't order there anymore) I received the items and want to return some of them. I go to the website to do the return.. follow the steps.. i enter in all the info.. it shows \"ups is having technical issues try again later\". I do so .. multiple times for multiple days. I finally reach out to customer service for a return label.. i am told the system is down come back later today. I do so... over the span of three weeks and 4 chats later. i keep getting told there is nothing they can do just to message them again before december 8th (that's when i am out of my return period) Now i'm tired of waiting because their return system has never worked for me and if it hasn't worked the last three weeks for them why should it the next time I message them. I ask for the USA return address already ready to pay for the return. They are not providing me with the info only the UK return address are not offering refund for shipping or ANYTHING. And when I ask what is going to happen if the system still isn't working by dec 9th (day after return time frame) the question is ignored and i am told again to wait.\n",

    "I have been placing orders from Asos for years now and I have had no issues.  However, earlier today I was left feeling cheated and disappointed.  I was about to purchase a jacket which was included in their Cyber Monday promotion.  The discount code had applied but due to to the fact that my order exceeded 500 sterling, I had to split my order in two.  In the meantime, this particular jacket was removed from the promotion and the discount code would now not apply! I went back to the promo filtering and it had been removed.   This jacket has been included in the promotion since earlier this morning! This is cheating to say the least.  To add insult to injury after speaking to the customer care representative for nearly an hour he basically said there was nothing he could do about and ended the chat when I pointed out that this is clearly Asos's mistake and it should be rectified - pointless customer care service!\n",
    "Harsh was responsive and very helpful with my query\n",
    "Clare is so helpful & kind! Amazing custom service.\n",
    "chat support could barely use English, did not resolve the problem, said someone else would fix it without giving a time frame, reference or anything else\n",
    "ASOS customer service is designed to make you give up trying to get assistance. When you do actually get to speak to a real person they have procedures which make it hard for the customer. Just don’t bother with them.\n",
    "If I could give zero stars I would! Ordered a NF jacket for my daughter never arrived, trying to get someone to help is an absolute nightmare! Contacting them daily now and still no further forward. Have asked for a refund refused asked for a replacement to be sent next day delivery to be told oh depends on stock. I checked stock prior to contact. They give you zero confirmation. Now 18 days after ordering I still have no jacket for my daughter and I’m £220 out of pocket! Never again will I use this company! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!\n",
    "had a great experience with customer service today spoke to a guy named Andrew he was very helpful and efficient couldn't of asked for anymore.\n",
    "ASOS return policy is not consumer friendly. I tried to return an item 29 days after receiving it and was denied because of its strict 28 day policy. This is less generous that nearly every other online retailer, which offers AT LEAST 30 days. The items I received were of poor quality and not what I expected. I won't be ordering anything from this company again.\n",
    "If I could give a zero i would. The jumper I ordered had a pink dot on it when i first placed the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returned it an they offered me a measly 20% discount which they were actually offering online! - pathetic\n",
    "\n",
    "Reordered the same item again which was delayed by another week and guess what?! They sent me the same jumper with the same pink dot and exactly the same way I packed it!\n",
    "\n",

    "My order query was successfully dealt with\n",
    "Prompt and had all the facts related to my issue without me having to explain which is actually very rare so I appreciated this very much\n",
    "Asos used to be a good store that sold quality clothes. Now, the quality of clothes is very poor. I bought four jackets, and three of them had to be returned due to poor quality, and I had to pay for the return shipping.\n",
    "Very helpful and sorted refund straight away for missing item\n",
    "Never rely on their next day delivery! I've ordered on Sunday 26th, 12.30 day time,and supposed to be delivered Monday 27th Nov. It was Tuesday 28th evening when i contacted them, and just said, sorry, is on it's way, just keep waiting. I did paid extra money for premier delivery, and they admitted that was their mistake, when they dispatched my item in the day that should be delivered, and apologies. It's been already 3 days and still waiting for my order, and all that they do is just say sorry and wait one more day. So why we pay for next day delivery when actually is like 3 or maybe more days.we pay for a service that doesn't do what it says. Is understandable maybe 1 day, but 3?when we pay extra for this? No way! So don't order relying that you get next day delivery! I've got proof and I'm willing to take this matter further. When I've asked why is this happening, they said, well we try to improve based on people opinions. So we, as customers, what do we get? A sorry, and keep waiting. Writing them a complaint, \"improving\" their business, do not help us, we pay for the next day delivery, and we do expect it so. They use Royal mail and blame on it.\n",
    "I spend roughly about £1000 a year with this company however, I will not spend a single penny more due to the fact that I was sent a pair of trainers that had a mark on and these trainers were £100 I went to the live chat to try and resolve it as I was not in a position where I could return it due to going abroad. The following day, they didn’t want to know and we’re very very unhelpful and condescending. and didn’t seem that bothered about losing a customer…. no wonder the company is struggling there are companies that have moved with the times and have alternative resolutions other than just a simple return, which isn’t always possible.\n",
    "Fed up the ‘next day’ delivery service you offer and not getting it next day.\n",
    "Never in my time as an adult have I ever witnessed a company that refuses to sell me anything after failing a 'security check' and when challenged to state that any further correspondence would be automatically deleted.  I have a credit score of 999 and the payment card used went through validation and the transaction was marked as pending.  It is unfathomable and quite bizarre - good luck - I do hope you eventually cease trading.\n",
    "Returned some items to receive an email saying they have closed my account due to suspicious activity and my refund won’t be issued. Nothing more than thieves and I will be taking this down the legal route.\n",
    "So I ordered a parcel to my old address by accident (I’m aware that’s my fault and I hold my hands up to that) HOWEVER! Once I realised about 10 minutes after I tried to change the address to my current address. Unfortunately ASOS seems to be living in 2001 and doesn’t allow its customers to change their address. So I tried to call ASOS, turns out their phone lines are permanently closed(brilliant). So I then finally managed to find a way to contact them via a chat. I asked to change the address and was told I could only do this before the order is confirmed. Well orders are confirmed instantly so that’s a load of rubbish. I then asked if they could cancel the order and re order it to my new address, they wasn’t capable of doing that either (shock). So I then decided to cancel the order myself as it was becoming such a pain. I then thought that would be that but no how stupid was I to think that. A few hours went by and I still hadn’t received my confirmation email to confirm my parcel was cancelled, so I chased them. I was told it would take a few hours. A few hours passed and you guessed it still nothing. So again I chased them and was told it would take 24 hours. It has now been well over 24 hours so I chased them for a third time. This time I was told the parcel intact won’t be cancelled and I will be receiving it at my old address!!! What an absolute joke! So now I have to go to my old address and collect it.\n",
    "Patient and thorough customer service from Joan and Pooja. I really appreciated their support.\n",
    "They use skynet to deliver to Qatar. Upon delivery i was charged 20£ to collect my package.£5 custom fees (which is fine). But £15 in broker fees and handling fees? Tried escalating to customer service chat but Durghesh decided to end the chat because he didnt know how to address the issue. Uninstalling and never buying from asos\n",

    "I wanted to return an item via an online form, but it offered no options from Germany (!). Three weeks after contacting numerous agents, bypassing useless AI, and wasting hours trying to solve the most straightforward issue, I gave up.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the agents managed to create a label manually, and each time, after doing the same old dance and repeating myself to oblivion, they would say, \"we are unable to process a return due to a technical issue.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "They cannot generate a return label via Hermes (due to said technical issue), and the other carrier they offer is NON-EXISTENT in Germany (Instabox pulled out in October 2022), lol.\n",

    "After explaining this to them a thousand times, I got forwarded to managers. Each time, and after an hour of repeating myself, they would finish the conversation with \"we are escalating this to our escalating team and will get back to you via email.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "No one ever does, ofc. They have no contact number one can call, nor do they have an email for official complaints or otherwise. Their customer service is designed to drive you insane and have you give up. It's a dead end.\n",

    "Was emailed to say that delivery will arrive at a certain date/time and now they're saying it'll be delivered a min of another week later which will be pointless because I'd ordered a whole outfit ($500+) for an event that would have happened already\n",
    "I’ve spent thousands over the years and have always loved asos. This week Monday I bought some wellies on next day delivery that I need for a charity event. It’s Saturday and I’ve not received so went through asos chat. The advisor admitted there’s delivery issues because of Black Friday and next day delivery is no longer an option when buying. But it was when I bought and I therefore asked for a refund. The advisor also admitted they probably won’t be delivered by Tuesday but I have to allow them 2 working days to get a reply from the courier. The event I’m attending will be over then so I’m going to have to buy another pair whilst asos still have my money. Poor show asos and I’m not going to be using you again. I’d forgive the error with advertising the next day delivery and letting me pay for it but the after service when your delivery time has not been met through your own fault is appalling. Additional your hat advisor cancelled the chat because I wouldn’t accept the situation. I was not rude and still had questions.\n",
    "…\n",
    "Customer service was very helpful and quick to solve my problem.\n",
    "Very poor customer service. I was charged for shipping fee despite the information on the website that says it is free. They are not able to help you. They lie to get ride of you or close the window. Same experience two times.\n",
    "I always shop with asos they are excellent excellent service all the time please keep up the excellent service asos thanks to all the asos teams kind regards\n",
    "Watch out when ordering with a discount code. If you send something back due to bad quality or damages, which happens often with ASOS clothing, and you fall just slightly beneath the amount necessary for the discount code, ASOS has introduced a new practice where they deduct the full discount amount of every single item from your refund. In my case, it would have been cheaper to keep the returned items because ASOS refunded me only a fraction of what I paid for them. I contacted them and tried to reason because I reordered the sent back items in a different size but it seems like they have changed their business model recently and don’t value a customer anymore. I have been a client for more than 7 years but ASOS has changed for the worse.\n",
    "My order was not delivered,  I’m paying ASOS premier for the special delivery service  ,made an order on 26th of November and on 29th of November still has not received. Contacted customer service and they can’t do anything about it ,just keep telling me to contact them later    If it will be not received ,so my question is why I’m paying ASOS premier service charge ? What’s the point of that service then ? my order was for the special event so now it’s all will be cancelled ,as my outfit has not arrived, that’s why I’m paying for this asos premier service to get the next day delivery , to be covered and also I ordered couple days in advance and still not arrived.I strongly don’t recommend to pay for your asos premier as you will not receive promised items on time and also the customer service will not help you with this and also if you want to raise a complaint with them just be aware that they don’t have any complaints department,this what the agent said to me on the chat.If you consider to buy asos premier just be aware that you can be in the same position as me  .\n",

    "I have received terrible customer service for your chat line. I originally ordered from your site 14 days ago and have been back and forth with 3 customer advisors 2 of which said my package would be here now, both said that the order was being fulfilled to find out the package is actually lost and had never left the Wearhouse despite it saying on the app it was on its way. I was also told that my parcel was on its way and the chat advisor even said it had next day delivery... That was almost a week ago. I'm really unhappy with the service I've received. Now I have to wait 10 working days for a refund, I can't afford to wait 10 days :(terrible service\n",

    "USE ANOTHER COMPANY THAT VALUES YOUR BUSINESS- Terrible customer service, this company has no idea what they’re doing. They’ve taken my order, which they can’t even find. They keep asking me to wait 24 hours and then 48 hours. Then longer it’s ridiculous!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Company service levels aren’t as they used to be!\n",
    "Would give 0 if it were possible. ASOS have changed their carrier making it absolutely impossible to get anything delivered and they take absolutely zero accountability for this!! I for one will be speaking with my feet and never ordering from them again! Don’t waste your time getting on to Customer Service….. Absolutely useless\n",
    "Having been using ASOS since 2017, they have randomly blocked my account? It has happened to others, check Twitter. I also pay for the premium delivery, and they now want me to pay to send my returns back? Ridiculous\n",

Ending the chats in middle without resolving the issue in 3 different occasions, regarding the same order. So disrespectful, absolutely unbelievable. My issue still not resolved!!!!\n",
    "This shop is the worst. I ordered several jumpsuits for my wedding, but because I am quite tall, none of them fitted. I did not receive my money back for one of them, because they claim it was used. All tags are still on the piece and obviously I did not wear it, but because there is a ca. 2mm stain on the INSIDE that might have come from trying it on, they are now saying it cannot be accepted and I lose over 230€.\n",
    "I know law is on my side and I should get a lawyer, but I am sure asos will just bury everything with counterarguments until I give up so not worth investing my time and energy into this. Obviously I should have checked the rating here first, but I guess from now on I know.\n",

    "Very nice conversation, thank you for your help!\n",
    "I have had a previous issue with ASOS before when I was sent used shoes but I let that slide as it was just the bottom of the shoes. I placed an order that had the promo code applied, after checking out, I realized I was charged the full amount. ASOS claimed they have a specialist team that deals with those issues and I should be patient and wait a reply, after the agent gave me a cheeky comment of ‘ I like proactive customers like you’, I honestly wasn’t sure how to take this.After asking numerous times for a time scale on the specialist team getting back to me in regards to the issue, I was then told “no time scales can be given”. After doing a quick search and seeing a number of people had the same issue and after receiving their order, ASOS refused to do anything about it, I asked for my order to be cancelled, I was told I could do it from my end but I had no options to do that. I was then told that I could no longer cancel the order and that I had to wait to receive my order and then process a return and then wait to receive a full refund.it is indeed sad to see ASOS go downhill like this and reading all the numerous reviews left, it’s obvious that the customer is no way a focus of this once beloved company.\n",

    "ASOS no longer viable. I’m a premium member since it’s introduction, but last year I was on the fence about renewal because of the change of terms and the temporary removal of express post. This year scraping free returns on top of the increased minimum spend - it’s no longer viable as my go-to store. You need to have consistent and accurate sizing if you’re going to force customers down this route. Previously the risk was with ASOS when they misrepresent sizing, now they’ve flipped it and charge the customer to return clothing because of their misrepresentation of items. I also did my first paid return, received by ASOS on 9/10 and still no refund 2 weeks later, but they’re now giving themselves a month to accept your return. I’m sure I’m not the only one who’s given the premium feature a miss this year but I also can’t see myself buying from ASOS again.\n",

    "Awful customer service. Received a faulty item. Had to return it on request of the ASOS team in order to receive a refund. I returned it but it was rejected as a return because it was outside the 28 day return period. The customer service rep said this might happen but to give the helpdesk my chat reference number to issue the refund. After a second hour long chat conversation where they said this chat reference couldn't be found and didn't listen / understand the situation, they asked me to return the item. An item that I had already returned! So they sent it back to me, to return again and repeat the process. When repeating this process the same thing happened all over again, with their chat representative saying they couldn't see any conversation regarding a refund. Luckily i took screenshots. After a painful process, they said they have issued a refund but can't provide a timeline or email confirmation!\n",

    "Yesterday, I received an email from InPost confirming that an ASOS return left in one of their lockers had been 'lost'. I contacted ASOS and got a refund (£72). Fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "While checking my PayPal account, I discovered that two other ASOS returns hadn't been refunded. I'd posted them in the same locker on 21 October. I checked the tracking on them and both were \"in transit\" - i.e. \"lost\" or, as is more likely given the pattern here, \"stolen\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So I contacted ASOS again and spoke to a helpful chap called Nitesh. He confirmed in writing that he'd these two returns: one for £170, the other for £355.88. Great, I thought. I got emails confirming the £72 and £170 returns but not the £355.88. Probably just a delay in the system, right? I'll check in the morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, today I wake to an email from ASOS that reads: \"After an assessment of your account, we’ve made the decision to not process your claim as your account activity is not in line with our Terms and Conditions. Your account has been deactivated and we’ve made the decision to not accept any further orders from you. In the event that any orders are placed on a new or any associated accounts they will be automatically cancelled and your account and any associated accounts will be deactivated, as per our Terms and Conditions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "No explanation, no more ASOS account and, importantly, no refund (despite me having it in writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "I immediately went to the customer service chat and they told me that this decision had been taken at the \"highest escalation\" (whatever that means). I asked for an explanation and was told they couldn't give me one because my account had been closed. At this point it's bordering on a weird Kafka-esque nightmare. My returns get lost/stolen and for some unknown reason my account gets cancelled and ASOS decides to keep my £355.88 (sounds a bit like fraud to me) - but they won't tell me why.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's weirder is that, according to the email, if I take this up with PayPal, ASOS will \"be able to provide information to them regarding your account to support their investigations.\" But I can't have that information?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a complaints email? No, I'm told. How do I contact someone more senior? You can't, I'm told.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been told that any contact on this matter will be ignored. I sent another return recently, for £216 - will I get that refund?\n",
    "\n",
    "So I've come on here to warn other customers and hope that someone reasonable from ASOS reads this and does something about it (refund, reinstatement, apology, maybe a token of their regret at treating a long-time customer like this). Because it's so bad it's almost unbelievable.\n",
    "Placed an order on November 24th which was delivered next day but I wasn't at home so it was chucked it into my side garden , didn't realise it was there until I checked my e-mail the following day , went to get the parcel and it had been stolen , tried to contact asos , customer care number no longer in use and no proper e-mail address , just the on line robot that has me going round in circles and going nowhere fast , any advice would be really helpful . . . Also contacted dpd deliveries who are telling me to ring asos which don't have any phone number , what a headache\n",
    "I have been a customer of ASOS for many years now, but they have always disappointed with the next day delivery service and refund. I've had enough this time!!!!!\n",
    "1.I placed my order on the 22/10/2023 for next day delivery, they did not come next day, and not the following one, I received an email after 4 working days that they have now tried to deliver my item.\n",

    "WHY SHOW UP AFTER 4 WORKING DAYS WHEN YOU PROMISED NEXT DAY DELIVERY ????\n",
    "\n",

    "Be careful buying on asos website! It happened to me twice already that I bought few things and when I refunded they don’t REFUND FULL AMOUNT YOU PAID! By covering themselves with a policy I don’t even know if it’s legal ? They offer so many discounts ( today everything 10% off) and when you add that discount later when you are asking to refund they don’t refund full amount. Example I paid £80 for 2 items and I got refund £62.40 how that’s that work? That I lost the rest of the money? Never ever again I am buying anything from them! Be very careful! It cause me a lot of stress which is not needed at all!\n",

    "I openly admit I made mistake on first order with address but after I corrected it ASOS continued to get it incorrect, so after 3 weeks 1 lost parcel lost counts of pointless emails I tracked the parcel and redirected it to my home, thanks for no help at all\n",
    "Joshua was amazing. Give him a bonus\n",
    "I have hung on to ASOS for so long, hoping they will acknowledge their negative customer feedback and make improvements as the \"old\" ASOS seemed faultless. However, as they move towards a 'fast-fashion' brand rhetoric by, in my opinion, churning out cheap and poor quality products that never fit correctly and 99% of the time do not arrive at the date promised or even the date paid for when you pay for a faster delivery service! This all in an effort to fill their greedy pockets with more and more money. I nearly gave up when I found out they'd partnered with Evri/ Hermes, due to their renowned negative reputation, and had multiple parcels delayed and some completely displaced. Still, I remained loyal and chose not to give up. Every company has to save cost somewhere, right? A cheaper courier makes sense. But no, this budget cutting method has affected the quality of the products, the quality of customer service, website usability etc. The whole thing just feels cheap and rubbish. It seems like not even that long ago, buying from ASOS felt like a treat! This was reflected by the high quality of products they sold and the excellent delivery, returns and aftersales service. Now just a distant memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today was my last straw. I accidentally cancelled a 2-part order in full when really, I only wanted to cancel 1 item on the order. There was no option to do this and the whole process was very confusing. When I spoke to Sarrahmay, she told me it was not possible to reverse this. So I went to rebuy the product and had a 10 minute back and forth with her about product availability, because she hadn't bothered to check that the size I wanted was back in stock. I then missed the Black Friday offer of 20% discount. When I got in touch today, I requested if this could be price-matched to my previous order. It took Ronak half an hour to tell me this was impossible. I was then randomly passed on to another sales advisor, Mohd, who again, stated that his systems would not allow him to generate a discount code. Absolute nonsense. One of the many reasons I have purchased from ASOS was due to their excellent aftersales service that has hugely declined in the last few years. They used to generate good will discount codes on many occasions, which gave me enough faith to continue purchasing with them. Please bear in mind, this was to match a purchase I had already made, so they were losing NOTHING by giving me this discount. When I requested for this to be escalated to a supervisor, I was refused and told to go back on live chat later (so now it has become the customer's responsibility to resolve their own issue). I also asked for a complaints contact and was, again, refused. There is no avenue to escalate issues and everything has been designed to put money first and customers last. You can clearly see this by the shocking state of their customer reviews, that continues to worsen.\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't tell you not to buy from ASOS. In fact, I implore you to buy from them just once. Once is all you'll need to put you off ASOS for life.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, I found the product elsewhere with a 25% discount and free next day delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you would like to spend your money only to receive a faulty, poorly made product, that you may never actually receive, from a company that is impossible to contact, with aftersales teams (of whom I'm convinced are trained only in sickly sweet hellos and goodbyes, and fobbing off the customer) to end up resolving your own order issues, then this is definitely the retailer for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Me, however, never ever ever again. At this rate, I should think they'll soon be joining the graveyard of lost retailers, forgotten beside the headstones of Topshop and Debenhams...\n",
    "Good response and assistance 5 star treatment\n",
    "If I could I would rate 0!\n",
    "ASOS have refused to refund my item which I didn't receive and have banned me from their website...\n",
    "The most awful customer service experience. You have seriously gone down hill ASOS. I had a parcel come today damaged with 2 items in, was agreed after speaking to an advisor for 30 minutes that they were really sorry and they would replace/refund both items to me and there was no reason to return, I thought this was great. When I got my confirmation of refund I realised they had selected the wrong item, which was of a lower value. I contacted again but this time told it wasn’t within their policy and the previous advisor was wrong to have agreed that and that they would not honour that agreement. I have been told to return the item, but I have no packaging to return it in as the delivery box was damaged on arrival and ASOS have told me on asking to put in a formal complaint, that they have no complaint process. Deeply disappointed with this company, nothing is packaged safely, customer service atrocious and they just go back on their word and argue with you.\n",
    "Arianne was very helpful and kept me informed.\n",
    "Lovely support, always available and helpful\n",

    "Tells you you can take 15% off with the code …… when you add it to your basket.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add the code in the checkout it’s not applicable for this item ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well why state it is ?\n",
    "This clause of using asos discount codes has not been made known at all and I think is very sneaky. I never write reviews but I wanted to make sure other people are aware of this so they don't end up with an unexpected full priced bill (after returning part of their order) after using a discount code when the order was placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "After using asos for years I have NEVER seen this before. I ordered several different black trousers and shirts for work uniform and applied the ASOS15 discount code to get a 15% discount for spending over £150. When I then returned the pairs that I didn't want/that didn't fit and went to pay for the remaining products (on Klarna) that I had kept, all products were billed as fully priced and not discounted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking it was an error I contacted customer service and was told it was because the order was now not over £150 as I had returned items from the order so the discount now couldn't apply????\n",
    "\n",
    "So ridiculous !! When the order was placed it was over that amount, just because I sent a couple of items back - now they somehow can retract the discount? I would not have kept the items if I knew they were full price and I cannot send them back now as I have used them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I understand not discounting my refund with the entire orders discount but SOME discount should come off relative to how much is kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not happy at all with ASOS and everyone that I have told about it has been shocked as they hadn't heard of this clause either. At a time when everyone is relying on discounts as times are tight, I feel many others are going to get caught with the same clause and be forced to pay full after ordering under the illusion of ASOS's sneaky little 'discounts'.\n",
    "Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with ASOS, I have returned 2 items in one package  and I was only refunded for one. The customer agent told me I have to wait a further 10 days. Then he stated the problem is with my bank. And told me to check my bank. There is no problem with my bank. As I clearly sow the refund for one of the items. The customer agent said that they will provide me a refund email. Then  2 minutes later goes on to say he actually can’t do it. I have never been provided with an email confirming refund. The customer service experience  I have had with ASOS has been a nightmare. I never thought that getting a refund would be such a headache. Staff need to be further trained. When asked how to make a complaint they said there is no email or option. I have now been told there was an error with payment and they need to process a Mannual refund. Agent said he need to contact specialist then didn't hear from me for more than a minute then disconnected with no action plan or telling me next steps. After I was on the live chat for nearly an hour. And throughout the majority of the chat I was told it was my bank error and to wait a moment. Only for them to turn around and say they made a mistake. ASOS what will you do to fix this i would like my money back?\n",
    "Xyron very helpful on chat when I had a query.\n",
    "I have used ASOS for years now I’ve never had a problem. Recently I placed an order of an item by accident, I contacted ASOS almost instantly to inform them I don’t need it and asked if I’d be ok to send it straight back. They had put a note on my account! When the parcel came, I didn’t check it and sent it straight back (it was a cleansing item therefore came in a white package also therefore didn’t open it). This went straight back! A few weeks later it was returned to myself. I contacted asos instantly and was told that the warehouse team informed them it was in a ‘heavily used’ condition. I was shocked as I hadn’t even opened the parcel. I provided asos with evidence however was greeted with rude staff and agents. I was told this would be passed onto a higher expert team to deal with. Since this time, I have realised the item is faulty therefore have contacted asos on a few occasions trying to inform them of this, I have been ignored, dismissed and rudely passed from pillar to post. I have still had no contact from the ‘expert’ team that was meant to be contacting me, an agent even told me that this didn’t exist so I’m not sure whether asos has told me this to calm me down.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am now being forced to pay for an item I 1. Don’t want 2. Don’t need 3. Can’t afford as ASOS can’t even pay attention to the fact I have been sent a faulty item.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been made out to be a liar.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have seen other posts on social media about asos doing this to other people who are innocent.\n",

    "Brilliant customer service very helpful resolved problem straight away.\n",
    "After 10+ years as a customer of Asos, ordering clothes on an almost weekly basis for most of that time my account was blocked. I was offered no explanation and upon contacting the live chat customer service was told I needed to wait to hear from the “specialist team”. I raise that I had sent off some returns already that had been marked as delivered but had not yet been refund. They told me that only the “specialist team” could resolve this matter.\n",
    "I also had some items I had yet to return and was told I would need to pay to send these items back myself and would get a refund as long as they were within the 28 day period (which they were). I had to pay nearly £10 to send these items off tracked and made sure to get ‘signed for’ so I could confirm they were delivered. I included a piece of paper detailing each item and order number that were in the return and included my contact details if there were any issues. So now with 2 returns sent and no refund for either I waited patiently to hear from their specialist team.\n",
    "After some time I finally had a response but was still offered not explanation for my account being closed and told only that my account was to remain closed permanently and that I could not reply to the email as it would not be responded to. No mention of either refund so was no closer to a resolution. I once again contacted the live chat as this is the only method of contact for Asos. They once again however informed me I needed to wait for the “specialist team” to review my case even though I mentioned I had already received this email. I raise again that I had outstanding returns that had not been refunded but was told there was nothing they could do and I would have to wait, so I waited.\n",
    "2 weeks went by, still no refund, still no contact from anyone at asos; I returned to the live chat. After explaining my case for a third time with a different live chat employee I was told that my case had been closed and was given a copy and paste of the email I had already received some time before. At this point I was extremely frustrated having followed all their instruction and waiting all that time I was still no closer to getting a refund let alone an explanation. I asked to speak to a manager or if I could have a contact number to call to escalate this further but was once again told that I would need to wait for the “specialist team” to resolve this matter. After some back and fourth getting nowhere I begrudgingly, once again, agreed to wait.\n",
    "Another week has now past and I’m still no closer to a resolution. Asos have a significant amount of money that is owed to me in returns that were returned well within the time period. I have provided them with proof of delivery for both and yet they continue to tell me to wait for an email that I feel isn’t coming.\n",
    "This is without a doubt some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced, given the amount of money I have spent with this company over such a long period you would think they would offer some kind of explanation for closing my account. My only hope now is that the items I’ve sent back are refunded as soon as possible so that I may move on and spend that money elsewhere.\n",

    "I ordered 7 items last Wednesday, parcel arrived Thursday. Only 6 items arrived. Contacted ASOS by chat facility to enquire where the missing item was to be told they most probably forgot to pack it or it was lost in transit. Refund issued for that item. I double checked with Robinjerick that it was the right dress as had ordered 3 dresses but in different colours and he confirmed twice he'd refunded the correct item. I also had to email whilst on the chat to Robinjerick images of 1. A khaki dress I ordered was actually just a jumper I received. It stank of absolute B.O. revolting. 2. The grey crochet dress had three holes in it. 2 at the front and 1 under the armpit and was stretched out of shape. 3. The mustard dress had pulls in it. He checked the images and I asked for a returns label. He emailed one. Packed the 6 items up (returning the others as poor quality and too small). Thought that was the end of it. Received an email from ASOS refunding the wrong item so unable to return that item as he'd refunded it. Got back on chat to Ayush this time. She processed a refund. No email came.

    "I must express my disappointment with Asos. Recently, I've noticed a significant increase in prices just before Black Friday, only to find that they are now offering discounts. This seems quite misleading and raises concerns about the transparency of their pricing practices. It's disheartening to observe that Asos raised prices before promoting Black Friday sales, making it appear as if customers are getting a great deal when, in fact, many sale items have seen a noticeable hike in prices. I've been diligently monitoring prices for the past month in anticipation of Black Friday, and it's disconcerting to see the apparent manipulation of prices. This situation leads me to question the integrity of Asos' sales strategy. Raising prices ahead of a major sale event and then claiming to offer discounts can be perceived as deceptive and, in my opinion, borders on fraudulent. As a consumer, I believe it's crucial for companies to maintain transparency and fairness in their pricing practices. It's disappointing to think that some customers may be misled during this supposed shopping bonanza. I sincerely hope that customers become aware of these practices and consider making more informed choices. Such tactics can erode trust, and it's my hope that consumers take a stand against such practices by boycotting companies that engage in them. Please Asos, there's no need for a compelling email denying that this has occurred. Instead, I urge the company to reflect on how sales and pricing are managed. Transparency and honesty should be the cornerstone of any business, especially during significant events like Black Friday.It is my sincere hope that Asos takes this feedback seriously and considers reevaluating its approach to sales and discounts. Consumers should feel confident that they are genuinely benefiting from sales events rather than being misled by inflated prices that are later discounted. Such a shift in approach could go a long way in rebuilding trust with the customer base.In conclusion, I encourage Asos to prioritize transparency, fairness, and ethical business practices. The long-term success of any company is closely tied to the trust and loyalty of its customers, and I believe addressing these concerns will contribute to a more positive and sustainable relationship between Asos and its clientele.\n",

Second day now after leaving this review I had ordered North Face jackets who partner with Asos I’m warning you don’t do it go straight to the retailer for your items if you need to return them Asos haven’t a clue how too they will fob you off I was passed to five different customer service agents one sent me a evri label where it isn’t supposed to go to so would have caused more problems good job I’m not as dim as them so I got m back to them then they tell me they can’t give me a label I have to wait for an email now I’ve read I have to contact customer services as North Face isn’t even on there list it’s a joke never will I shop with them again bunch of clowns 🤡\n",
    "Excellent customer service from Mohamed at ASOS 😀\n",
    "Did not help at all.\n",
    "Wasted 50 minutes\n",
    "Poor service, still waitin on my refund\n",
    "The response from customer support was timely. The representative was warm and friendly.\n",
    "Antonette was very helpful on the live chat. After speaking to several advisors, only Antonette was able to help me to receive my refund.\n",
    "Nutan was lovely and very helpful. resolved the issue effectively.\n",
    "Just got my delivery yesterday from them and they've sent me a pair of pants so stinky and filthy I would say. Their quality service is a joke if they think it's acceptable to sent to their customers used and filthy products most probably worn by some other customer and returned (not even checked properly and pack to be delivered to the next order). This is mot hygienic as you can assume and I won't even bother to return the item, I will jusy bin it as I don't want another second with stinky smell in my house. Is not the fist time and won't be the last time they do it. Until now I have returned and report all their faulty orders and nothing changed. From now on I will review them on different websites so at least people know what sort of company this is.\n",
    "My problem was resolved quickly and easily\n",
    "I had a size notification for a coat and after months of waiting I got a email to say it was in stock. I went onto asos straight away and ordered. They still use everi ( worst delivery company ever ) I was meant to get the delivery Friday but didn’t turn up. It came the Saturday. I had been sent a pair of ladies trousers. I created a return straight away for the qr code went to four different places code wasn’t working. Spoke to someone on live chat and I had to tell them what they needed to do. Got emailed a qr code that didn’t link to my return or notify me it was posted etc. ended up opening a PayPal dispute where asos incorrectly told me with a open dispute they couldn’t issue a refund. Provided PayPal with pictures proof of postage chat history and I’ve now been refunded.\n",
    "My issue was resolved quickly and efficiently with a happy to help attitude!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Many thanks x\n",
    "Worst experience ever. Auspost returned the parcel to them and they don’t have the decency to process my refund. I thought they were a serious company. It has been weeks.\n",
    "Worst experience will not buy again!\n",
    "Recieved 2 items over 2 seperate orders, both items faulty. Sent back and was charged a return fee for both taken out of my refund.\n",
    "Another time paid for express shipping $30 for a $300 order, figured it was worth it for a larger order. Asos cancelled the two most expensive items and refused to refund me the difference between regular and express shipping despite the fact I would never have paid $30 to ship a $40 item. Add insult to injury it took over 10 days for item to be delivered, double the quoted time. Finally BEWARE, this company scams you! Here’s how it works for Australians anyway. You cannot return anything for change of mind because you are advised to return it to them within 28 days of delivery. Now that all sounds fine until you go into the fine print “returns can take 21 BUSINESS days to reach us” notice the odd 1 on that 20! That’s so even if you send the item back the day you received it, the final number of days including at least 4 weekends that it takes to reach them is a minimum of 29 days! You got it, and they hold you responsible for the time it takes to get to them using THEIR nominated freight carrier and of course they won’t guarantee a delivery date. I will never buy from this company again!\n",
    "I have been using asos for YEARS, i buy most of my clothes from there, having a lot of brands and different sizes of there i generally have to buy a lot of different items to find one that fits well.\n",
    "However recently they have been messing up my returns and only partially refunding me. So I have had to go on the online chat to sort this out.\n",
    "After the past three occasions of them not processing returns correctly, they have now de activated my account, meaning I have 6 months of asos premier which I cannot use.\n",
    "Ordered shoes for my partner as an Xmas present, to be sent out the US size instead of the UK size (as if it's hard to double check correct sizes, apparently for asos it is)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrote to customer service SPECIFICALLY JOE AND USHA, only to be told that I have to \"return the item (which takes 10 days), WAIT ON the refund, and then reorder the item all over again\"\n",
    "\n",
    "NOW, bare in mind this is the company's error.\n",
    "One of their employees is clearly incapable of differentiating UK from US sizes.\n",
    "And THEN when that happens they are going to drag it out as LONG as possible (AT CHRISTMAS) making you return the item and do all the work yourself before they even bother to lift their useless fingers to send your money back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, NO CORRECT ITEM SENT OUT😂😂😂\n",
    "\n",
    "NO PROPER CUSTOMER CARE IN PLACE FOR WHEN THEY MESS UP.\n",
    "\n",
    "NO. Instead they treat you as if you're the one in the wrong. They treat you like an IDIOT! Not as if they have mucked you around and took your money for something wrong. Oh no.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to return the item taking 10 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait on their useless team approving the return\n",
    "\n",
    "WAIT ON them sending the money back into your bank (NEVER INSTANT, MOST OF THE TIME YOU WILL WAIT UPTO A WEEK FOR YOUR MONEY TO GO BACK IN YOUR BANK ANYWAY😂😂😂😂)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then FINALLY after about 2 or 3 weeks of being messed around by this disgraceful company, you can reorder your item when you've had to fight for your money back. Having to go through the WHOLE STUPID PROCESS AGAIN .\n",
    "\n",
    "I literally tried to question for ages WHY they wouldn't send me out the correct size instead of making me wait on sending it back for a refund.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only to be told they \"don't tolerate being offensive\" and dropped from the chat because I didn't readily let them walk all over me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe from customer service, you do realise me pointing out flaws in your companies shoddy customer care and asking if yous would be happy recieving the disgraceful treatment isn't being offensive is it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining I should have rights as a customer WHEN YOU MESS UP isn't being offensive.. is it😂😂\n",
    "\n",
    "You dropped me from the chat because I kept pressuring you with valid points. Your customer service is exactly what I said it is and you clearly didn't like it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Awful awful company to deal with especially when they mess up, you're told how they are going to handle it and if you don't like it then tough.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are forced to wait.\n",
    "You are forced to REORDER\n",
    "\n",
    "There's ZERO customer care, ZERO accountability, and ZERO Chance you're going to be a return customer after this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not buy through asos. Best advice you'll ever read.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm allowed to express my disgust for asos, unless of course you're joe from\n",
    "Customer service in which case prepare to be dropped from the chat and told \"I coulda helped you but basically I won't bye\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid 100x\n",
    "Their customer service is shocking!!! I'm disabled and got into accident and I broke my foot on the way to returning my parcel. It was one day late and they wouldn't make me a new label to be able to return it. Mirza the managers response was \"you should have got someone else to return it\". I was in an accident do you really think that was my first priority!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first advisor I spoke to said he would make me a new return label. I have this in writing. But he ended the chat before he did that. And the next advisor I spoke to took soooo long to reply and said they wouldn't give me the new label. And didn't even habe the decency to write me a response. He just kept copy and pasting the same response even when called out on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then asked to speak to a manager and was spoken to by Mirza who was more concerned about her reputation and figures then actually helping me. And then had the audacity to say she gave me the \"Best resolution\" when she didn't give me any resolution. And just said she couldn't make me a new label\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't the first i have been lied to by asos. I made a return in September and never recieved my refund. I chased it up 3 times each time them saying I just have to wait a little bit longer. Until after a month of chasing it they told me the warehouse had rejected my return ( didn't recieve an email about this) but they couldn't tell me the reason it had been rejected. After complaining alot the manager said the parcel was being sent back to me. But if I contacted asos when It arrived then they would make me a label so I could return it....Guess what the parcel never cake and 2 weeks later when I chased it up again they told me the return was never rejected and I was given the wrong information. And I finally got my refund.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its disgusting that asos don't look after their customers. They take so long to reply and just give you copy and pasted responses. They give you the wrong information and when you tell them they are wrong they don't even bother to check. Totally lazy and they need training to actually deal with problems\n",
    "Well what can I say. First time ordering and my parcel wasn’t delivered, got to wait till Monday now. Also nice to see asos replying to customers not, won’t be using again that’s for sure\n",
    "Vikas from the online help chat was utterly brilliant resolving an issue with my order. Thanks again Vikas.\n",
    "Marco was extremely helpful and offered a replacement. I expressed my dissatisfaction with the courier (UPS) and he offered to let the company know.  He was really nice and answered all my questions efficiently.\n",
    "What a joke- ordered outfit that was supposed to be for a wedding. Zero movement on tracking for over three weeks. Parcel failed to arrive more than two weeks after expected date of delivery. Still no movement on tracking. Dodgy b***** don’t provide an email address or phone number for sorting issues out, only the ridiculous live chat. Great if you want to be disconnected every five minutes and need to reconnect and get a different person every time who you have to then re - explain everything to and still have no explanation or resolution. Will never buy from this dodgy company ever again.\n",
    "Good Customer Service team, but the returns process is an absolute shambles. If the returns process takes up to 15 days, then it should take up to 15 days. I should not have to reach out to the Customer Service Team every time I return something, to manually receive my refund. Especially when my return is sitting in your warehouse for 13 days! You expect me to pay you before you dispatch my purchase, so why do I have to wait weeks for you to refund my money?\n",
    "I chatted with an agent called Preeti they sorted my problem straight away they provided me with great service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you\n",
    "Customer care assistant Bhupender was good but the situation is annoying\n",
    "Great custome service but shame about delivery just not turning up\n",
    "AWFUL COMPANY!\n",
    "\n",
    "3 out of 4 items were missing from my parcel, ive tried to contact asos customer care a dozen times at this point but everytime they tell me to start chat with an actual human it opens this link chat.gnatta.com but its just a blank page that never loads! im missing items and asos have STOLEN my money at this point and im extremely angry and just want this to be sorted out so i can get my refund! please asos sort out your virtual assistant because it’s absolute rubbish\n",
    "Joshua helped me on live chat with an issue with one of my orders. Friendly and sorted the issue really quickly! Great customer service, Thank you.\n",
    "Excellent customer service, issue was resolved quickly\n",
    "Amazing, very helpful customer service. Thank you for your help\n",
    "Ordered a coat paid next day Evri then sent an email to say out for delivery then cancelled for no reason. Spoke to a person over the chat for 2 and a half hours but they refused to call Evri refused to give a refund now telling me I have to wait for it to be delivered even though I told them I won’t be in the country for 2 weeks as of toMororw. Won’t refund my delivery charge won’t cancel the order so now I’m saying if it’s delivered and it’s left and someone takes it then what we’ll then what is I won’t get a refund the coat cost £85 and they won’t help\n",
    "So I won’t have to deal with them again. One of the worst companies I have ever bought from. Complete silence for three weeks although I’d been notified the courier had my parcel. When I contacted customer service I was told there was a problem with the parcel leaving the warehouse (?) and then I was notified I had a refund with no further information. One star for the really helpful Customer Services, but I imagine they get a lot of practice.\n",
    "asos is a scam. I checked my size in the data in the size guide, and it is size \"M\", I looked at the model's photo and with a similar height, this hoodie, judging by the shoulders, is too big for model, and it is written that he is wearing size M, I ordered size \"S\", and this size turned out to be too big! I needed size \"XS\" in this case! The difference between size M and XS is big. When I bought clothes from expensive brands, the sizes always matched perfectly. And these scammers don't admit it. They order cheap clothes from third countries, the sizes don't match and they don't refund postage on returns. The scammers make money from this, they charge £4.50 for Evri delivery. Whereas on the Evri website delivery costs £2.45 (0-1kg)! The delivery cost will be even cheaper for businesses. Elizabeth-parrot from support is absolutely useless. Keep in mind that this is a lottery for your money.\n",
    "Had an issue with and order. Refund was processed straight away. No hassle\n",
    "Absolute scum. Irish customer doing a return. 15 working days and it took a threat of a solicitor to convince online asos chat customer service that the package exsisted. Showed proof of tracking number, tracking history. Enquired to an post the Irish postal service to provide anything they could and we posted that also. Still over 3 hours of denial from asos we finally got our refund. We will avoid asos from now on. Feels like a company that’s going bust.\n",
    "It's a joke the trainers I got are worn , and not in the original box .\n",
    "\n",
    "Disgusting selling as new\n",
    "I've been a ASOS for couple years while paying for premier delivery services annually. Earlier this year I cancelled my subscription as I was not going to buy much for the time being. Few days ago I went on the ASOS website to browse and possibly shop for the holidays and learned I've been blocked. Upon getting in touch with the customer service, they didn't give me a reason or didn't address why I'd been blocked and left me by saying they have forwarded the issue to higher ups. Today I get an email from them that they have decided not to accept any further orders from me and left a beautiful line at the end of the email that says exact words\n",
    "\"As we’re unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed with no response.\"\n",
    "That is some very bad customer service. The email doesn't state why or any reason of being blocked/ banned. I've never gotten any email or any sort of communication from them regarding anything and now without any answers they would not help me further with whats going on. Just great service. Really bravo on how bad a company can be.\n",
    "P.s - I've made hundreds of dollars in purchases in the 2 so years and rarely returned much and if I have it has only been size returns. They had accepted the returns and no issue then. Once I've cancelled subscription I am banned?!\n",
    "This can be regarded as just a rant and frustration coming out but still shows the true color of ASOS. I've noticed they have been under fire a lot by many other shoppers and still don't understand how they still operate. They need to be boycott period\n",
    "Would give zero if I could. £200 order lost in transit for over a week and keep getting told to contact again the next working day. Quick to take my money but struggling to resolve this issue. Do not recommend.\n",
    "Still using Evri so won’t be renewing my premier membership anymore as well once evri has the parcel who knows when it will turn up! Cheap delivery service\n",
    "Xyron was really kind to me and took his time to fix my problem. Thanks you Xyron\n",
    "Friendly customer service but as an overall ASOS should not take 10 days to be able to process a return in order to get a refund it’s silly when I buy an item they get the money asap but I have to wait for my money! It’s not the right way to go about business especially when I send my parcel back the next day and they had messed up themselves\n",
    "I had a parcel go missing and customer service promptly sorted this for me.\n",
    "I paid 38 euros for a 21 euro shirt and asos won’t return the difference. Worst experience I’ve ever had with a customer service. Will not be ordering with Asos again and advising all my friends and family to also refrain from doing so. Chatreference: 47982194\n",
    "Really helpful customer service team, they have helped resolve my issues several times :)\n",
    "Great customer service from Joshua as I had a faulty Item I needed to return or enquire about. The issue was resolved quickly and was friendly and helpful.\n",
    "Ordered an item and paid for next day delivery. The money was taken from my account instantly but received no order confirmation or details, chased it up when it didn't arrive the next day to be told the is no record of my purchase and that they couldn't event find my account. multiple efforts on chat spending 30 - 60 mins each time to then have the money refunded with no item.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 days later seen a pair of trail running shoes on sale at a great price, again purchased the item with a delivery time of 2- 4 days. £120 taken from my account, item hasnt arrived after 7 days so contacted ASOS to cancel, they did and said a refund would be processed, this was 2 weeks ago and customer service again take an hour to 'investigate' the situation only to be told, you must wait for your money because they can not track or find the item! not my problem, not my mistake, not my property, but they have my money. Pretty sure taking payment and not offering the goods or service in return is fraud / theft. total joke, will never use them again.\n",
    "Joan was amazing!! She deserves a pay rise. Thanks Joan girl you were great xxx\n",
    "Item arrived damaged they agreed refund but then cancelled as item wasn’t faulty.  I said damaged originally they cancelled refund didn’t tell me I chased twice was told I would have email soon. Chased again told their system couldn’t refund as item was not faulty. It was damaged, still haven’t had refund. Terrible service haven’t revived one email from them\n",
    "Ordered a pair of trainers. Boxed ripped completely damaged. Trainers not packed properly. Customer service useless\n",
    "Spoke to Jessica via ASOS chat, was able to help me with my query and had a great outcome in the end. Pleasure to chat to.\n",
    "Next day delivery is pointless. I ordered an item to arrive next day, it hadn’t arrived by 8pm, I looked at tracking & it was sent by Royal Mail who said they hadn’t even received it. I chatted to someone online and they said they’d be able to sort it tomorrow as it could still arrive. So I then spoke to someone the next day and they said I would have to wait another 2 days before they could do anything. Even though I paid for next day delivery it’s taking at least 4 days to arrive! The customer service has been rubbish and not helpful at all\n",
    "It's been nearly two weeks and I haven't received my refund. I have live chatted multiple times only to be told to keep waiting. This is getting weird now and it's not policy. It puts buyers off because if you can take money so easily, and then not return it, why would I trust in you to make purchases? It's annoying.\n",
    "Don’t bother paying for premier, you most likely won’t get your items the next day and they won’t give you a refund. 3rd order ive placed since buying premier that hasn’t arrived on time, and when I asked for them to refund my premier charge as I am not getting the service I paid for, they basically said no. Don’t offer a service you can’t deliver!!\n",
    "I Chatted online to a very helpful person called ANDREW who is doing his very best to sort out my missing parcel. He was understanding and kind it felt like he cared about me as a customer and and older one at that. Who does not perhaps understand her way around the new delivery services that seem very complicated. He has helped to bypass this problem for me and promised to email me back. VERY EFFICIENT\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly STILL AWAITING REPLY and no sign of my goods . NOT AS EFFICIENT AS I WAS LED TO BELIEVE. NO RESOLUTION.\n",
    "Ashu was so willing to help me. Very kind. Great experience\n",
    "Very helpful and friendly. Darien very chatty/ positive and helped me out with missing parcel.\n",
    "Item was ordered on Saturday and was meant to be delivered on Sunday as I had paid for premium delivery. 5 days later, still no item - I've asked for a refund and been told I have to wait another 5 days whilst they carry out an investigation. Money taken from account, no item delivered and I'm not allowed a refund. Incredible levels of incompetence\n",
    "Worst online shopping experience I have ever had.  I place an order on next day delivery on 10th Nov.  Its now the 15th Nov and nothing has been delivered.  That's 6 days since I ordered item.I have now spent over 7 hours trying to resolve this with asos customer support since 12th Nov and getting nowhere.  Yesterday I'm told the courier has my parcel, today I'm told its still in the warehouse.  I asked for a refund and they refused, I'm told to wait several more days for delivery.  I was lied to and given poor excuses.  They must think people are backwards.You get a pathetic chat system and cannot speak to anyone anymore.  While the assistant goes off to check your order, the chat system disconnects you for inactivity and you have to go through the whole process again  and waste even more of your time having to explain the whole situation again.I will never use asos again and deleting my account.I buy a lot online from various outlets and not once have I ever received such poor customer service.Finally today I got a refund but what a battle it was to get it and over 7 hours of my time.Totally disgusted and cannot believe asos are getting away with this.  The service is not even close to a poor standard, its worse.\n",
    "I couldn't log in so made up an email , placed an order , the order has not been delivered and asos will not give me any info without email,  I have done everything I can to try and retrieve email with no luck and even though I have the order reference the date and time the order was placed ,the address ,phone number and obviously my name this is not good enough . Absolutely fuming customer service rubbish no one will help I want my 139 pounds back!!!!\n",
    "THE WORST COMPLAINT RESOLUTION. DPD MESSED UP MY DELUVERY AND HAVE BEEN GOING ROUND IN CURCLES TO REORDER. THE ORIGINAL CODE I USEDNIS NO LONGER WORKING SO I ASKED FOR ANOTHER CODE TO MATCH. IT HAS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK AND STILL NOTHING\n",
    "\n",
    "FINALLY THEYVE OFFERED ME 25% OFF CODE AS THE 20% CODE WOULDNT WORK WITH ORDERS OVER £500 BUT NOW THEYRE BACKTRACKING AND SAYING THWY CANT OFFER ME COMPENSATING FOR THEIR AWFUL SERVICE AND CAN ONLY MATCH THE OLD ORDER. IM GETTING REALLY ANGRY AND GOING RO CONTACT THE RETAIL OMBUDSMAN\n",
    "\n",
    "NO ONE READS EMAILS PROPERLY JUST KEEP BEING ASSIGNED TO A NEW PERSON WHERE THEY CLEARLY HAVENT READ ANYTHING.\n",
    "Absolutely the worst company when it comes to customer service. I bought a pair of airforces on the 5th of September before cut off time for next day delivery. My flight was in two days and parcel did not arrive on time therefore I requested the parcel to be delivered at a collection point so that DPD would return it after 7 days as stated on their website. I wouldn't be back in time in order to send them back if it had been delivered to my address. Furthermore, I contacted them on the 25th of September telling them that DPD would not collected the parcel and I wanted my refund. The first agent said they would refund or replace if problem was not solved before 3 days. Later on the same day I get an email from a \"specialist whatever\" saying that they opened an investigation and DPD requested 9 days. On the 4th of October they asked for 48h and later sent another email when I challenged them about my refund that I would need to wait another 9 days. They got back to saying the parcel was lost although I had told them that the parcel was at the shop because I had called the shop and confirm the parcel was still there. Their response was very much \"copy and paste\". Different email sent by different people. Eventually they stopped replying at all. They would saying DPD was investigating and to wait for them, I would call DPD and they would tell me to contact ASOS. Literally sending me back and forth. We are in mid November and I am continuously trying to fix the issue myself. So i called the shop a few days ago making sure the item was there (which apparently was lost) and requested them to collected because it had been sitting there for more than a month. DPD has now collected and delivered the parcel on the 11th and still nothing from ASOS regarding the refund (£109.95) still haven't replied to my email since the time I emailed them on the 1st of November. In addition, I contacted them 2 days ago and was told a specialist would contact me and still nothing. The customer service has gone downhill. I am absolutely disappointed because I have shopped with ASOS for years and unfortunately I just deleted my account not that they would care either. I just won't support a company with awful customer service. Unacceptable way of dealing with issues that they created themselves.\n",
    "I would give 0 stars if I could. Asos customer care agreed to do a late return for me on the 6/11/2023 which I was very appreciative of. I have it as evidence in an email and I was instructed that had to pay the return postage myself which cost £5. Previously before this email I had been told that it could be to discretion of the warehouse but in the last email there was no indication to this. So I was under the impression that Asos had agreed to do the refund.  I posted the item on the 7/11/2023 and now I have then received an email saying my return was rejected and am now being told it is \"out of date\". I have just been messed about by ASOS getting told one thing from one advisor to another saying that I was told it could have been rejected. If it was clear at any point on the last email that it might have not been accepted I would have not sent it back. Now I’m also being charged for them to return the item back to me.\n",
    "Today I have spoke with Ashu regarding my last refund as I was refunded and incorrect amount.\n",
    "and they were very helpful.\n",
    "Very good customer service.\n",
    "Ordered an advent calendar in September as my daughter desperately wanted the ASOS one so thought I’d get in early. Queried the delivery yesterday (they don’t normally come until November) and was told they had raised this with delivery company a few days before. I requested a replacement and was assured this and a few hours later was given a refund. Queried this again today and was told they have sold out. Only four now available and two of those are nails or necklaces. My daughter is going to be so disappointed. I will never use this company again.\n",
    "I'm so frustrated and disappointed in my purchase from ASOS. After waiting 2 weeks for my order, they sent me the wrong item and when I sent it back they did not give me a full refund Instead charged me for their mistake. There is no customer service to even try to get my full refund. I will never recommend or buy from them again!\n",
    "I bought a Valentino bag in August and it’s too small so I went to Facebook and Vinted to sell it. Both have indicated it is a fake. I approached ASOS for clarification but they said they only deal with legitimate companies. I am not convinced and asked them to look into the company. Their customer care is awful as there seems no one will look into the problem for me. You can’t speak to anyone senior and they say they will get back to you but don’t. I am still waiting to hear.\n",
    "Fantastic customer service and great prices.\n",
    "I spoke with John and he was extremely helpful and very friendly. A great member to your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks\n",
    "Jenny\n",
    "Manisha was so helpful! Sorted my refund there and then.\n",
    "I was having some issues and resolved very quickly thanks to the operator.\n",
    "Customer service is awful.  I had a faulty item, I had to send the item back twice as the first time it was rejected as it was not inspected properly, and it was sent back to me.  I then had to send it back again.  I had to spend over 6 hours on 4 different chats before I finally got a refund.   You can not actually speak to anyone on the phone, everything is done within a chat, where they take ages to respond.  In addition they do not leave notes from previous chat conversations, and you have to repeatedly explain your query everytime to chat to someone new.  Awful customer service, I doubt I will buy again from ASOS.\n",
    "Next day delivery does not work anymore. It used to be a punctual service. The products have not been dispatched yet after 4 days and I cannot get through the virtual assistant and its useless answers. I am afraid I am NOT going to use asos any more. Too bad\n",
    "Very bad company, I had few problems with them and I decided not to buy anymore stuff from them. They use cheap deliveries which they get lost with no refund, and their gift cards are valid for one year, once they expired you loose the money. This is a proper theft. You feel like you are deeling with Ryanair or something very cheap... One star is to much for such scamers.\n",
    "Connected to advisor quickly and advisor very helpful\n",
    "Taylor from the Asos customer care team was very helpful and efficient, my issue was quickly resolved. I had a great experience.\n",
    "Terrible shopping experience.\n",
    "Asos sent the wrong size - ok, mistakes happen.\n",
    "Had to go print return label, bring package to shipping pick up point and then re-order and pay for the item again, since they don't offer pick up of returns at home like other platforms do. A hassle but it is what it is.\n",
    "Then when the new package finally arrived, they managed to send the exact same wrong size again(!).\n",
    "Then want me to go print yet another return label, deliver the new wrong package to the shipping pick up point, and re-order the item and pay again for the third time to fix their (second) mistake.\n",
    "Have now used a ton of time on the black hole they call \"customer service\", have wasted time and money on the hassle of returning the wrong items, still haven't received two refunds, and haven't received my item yet and never will.\n",
    "Was offered \"compensation\" for my time and hassle of 15% on my next order - or in other words the \"compensation\" is that I give them more money. You get 20% just to download the app and higher percentages on any given Tuesday.\n",
    "Highly recommend using another marketplace that send the correct products or at least have a decent return system in place.\n",
    "Used to be a good place to find great prices but now it's just a worse shop for namebrands, if they started to focus more on their own pieces, I'd use it more...\n",
    "They have such an awkward process to get to talk to an actual human, who was very helpful when I got there but, the company of ASOS don’t really have a care in the world about their customers and aren’t bothered about customer satisfaction. I paid for ASOS premier, they failed to provide the one thing the service does and my parcel was marked as lost and there policy provides no compensation for customer’s inconvenience and time spent chasing down a human customer service. I was able to get a replacement order but I would like it if compensation came a long with it so that customers can have a good opinion of ASOS and know that if something does go wrong they know they will be okay. I guess they just want money money money.\n",
    "If I could leave a negative 5 star review I would. Among other complications, I was charged the wrong amount and was refused a refund. I spoke with Joshiahariel and they were incredibly rude and seemed to be happy to steal my money. I have never left a review before, but I’ve never had a customer experience has horrifying as this. There is nothing that could make me purchase from this corrupt store again.\n",
    "I always found ASOS customer care to be excellent but I’ve found them to have really gone downhill lately.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently returned an item of €49 which had a 20% discount so I should have been refunded €39.20.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also purchased a pair of loafers at the same time, €23 which was also discounted by 20% = €18.40.\n",
    "\n",
    "To receive this discount, I had to spend a minimum of €20 so even if I had only purchased the loafers - I would have received this discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to my customer care agent, because €18.40 is under €20, my refund of €39.20 has to also deduct the €4.60 discount of the loafers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes absolutely no sense and customer service agents don’t seem to understand the T&C’s they’re sending during these conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know it’s only a few euro but I’ve heard this happening more and more lately, as well as refunds being rejected. It’s really such a shame because ASOS was always my first place to shop.\n",
    "There is apparently a new policy that you have to return in 14 days. I received my order on the 31st of oct. Wanted to create a return order today on the 13 of November, but got rejected. According to customer care was I not within the 14 days policy. This is insane! Asos stealing money by changing the policies. I order a lot over the passed years, but never dare to order again! What a bad service. Not the costumer care person, this person is doing his job the strategy that have been told.\n",
    "I Ordered the same dress in a size 10 and a size 12 as I was unsure of the fit. The size 10 fit so I wanted to return the 12. I got a return code and then it expired on the day before i tried  to use it and I had not realised I missed the date by one day. I emailed the same date to ask for a 24 hour extension as the weekend intervened and I have not had a response. It’s now over a week since I emailed to explain and I still have had no response. It’s a little unfair to not even have an email acknowledgement. I don’t think I will use Asos again.\n",
    "Delivery hasn't arrived. Delivery notifications haven't been updated. Eventually got onto live chat, said they would look into it, I asked how I would hear back, was told I would get an email in 48h. Nothing has arrived. The text on the website says \"we'll do our best to help you\" this doesn't fill me with confidence. No idea how long I will have to wait to get my money back, or if I will, there is no process outlined on the website. I've received other items today from the same courier service just fine.\n",
    "Really bad customer service... kept getting disconnected on the chat service. They didnt help at all with my issue with a missing parcel!!! I would give it zero stars if i could. Wasted so much of my time and not helpful.\n",
    "John made my refund issue so easy and seamless great at his job and very polite friendly and professional .\n",
    "Another thing to check off my to do list done with ease. Very good customer service and support.well done ASOS happy to shop again again\n",
    "Aishleen resolved my issue. She was professional and fast\n",
    "Second time I've ordered from ASOS for next day delivery and haven't received my order on time. Has been at least 2 days late each time.\n",
    "I would rate them 0* if I could. My parcel was due to arrive on Friday, paid for next day delivery, it hasn't. Evri tracking is clearly showing it's lost at the depot but ASOS are making me wait 5 days before they'll do anything. I'm on day 4, I got in touch today for a refund, as advised to, but now I'm being told to wait another day? Incredibly unfair policy on the consumer. You've got my money, but I've not got my goods and clearly won't receive them. ASOS, particularly their customer service, have gone so downhill over the years. Avoid at all costs. I've spoken to 3 different agents over chat, all of which have been useless and not provided me with a solution.\n",
    "Ordered a fairly expensive item for next day delivery, it has now been four days and they are refusing to refund the item even though its gone and been lost in the abyss that is stupid Evri\n",
    "Paid £30 for a fleece, it arrived a day earlier than expected which was great. However, it was left on the floor in the middle of my driveway. I was sent a picture by my neighbour of where it was left, and when I got home it was gone. It wasn’t taken back for re-delivery, and the proof of delivery image I was sent was just a close up picture of my name and address sticker on the package, so for all I know could have been in the drivers vehicle.\n",
    "The worst customer service i have seen for a long time. very rigid. would not allow for returns after the 28 days in the policy regardless of the circumstances.\n",
    "Lester was very helpful in providing information regarding my return and refund. Attachments needed were also very easy to send so he could have all the information needed to find out details for me.\n",
    "horrific customer service ! avoid like the plague !\n",
    "I ordered several items on 4th September and returned some of them on 8th September and had the confirmation shortly after that they had been received at the warehouse. I have been waiting for my refund ever since. Today I had an email stating that the items will be returned to me as they weren't received within the 28 days returns policy! Used the chat function to talk to customer care and they couldn't help me as they couldn't see the reason why the items were rejected.\n",
    "My package never came and asos would not help\n",
    "Detailed and fast response.\n",
    "Quick solution to problem and helpful staff.\n",
    "Closed my account with no explanation. Emailed to query and told they will keep this closed. This came after having to spend 3 hours on chat to them to resolve returns they hadn’t processed.\n",
    "I’ve spent a hell of a lot over the years so very odd decision and the lack of explanation says everything about their customer service.\n",
    "My delivery hasn’t arrived, customer services say it’s been escalated, but nothing happens. They never get back to you when they say they will.\n",
    "I won’t use ASOS again as they use EVRI, I cannot deal with any company that uses them, it’s too stressful and untrustworthy.\n",
    "Great help from customer assistance to resolve my problem. But a bit hard to connect. Keeps saying request timed out, attempted 3 times to finally get to chat with someone.\n",
    "Joan was very helpful and patient! She sorted a couple of refund issues for me.\n",
    "Navita was extremely helpful and professional. Solved my issue right away\n",
    "The clothes arent great fitting sent for a return\n",
    "I have been a shopper of ASOS for a long time.\n",
    "Recently there has been endless issues with how items have been shipped:\n",
    "Dirty, marked, prior worn, without tags and incorrect items.\n",
    "The customer care used to be 10/10 however now the care is just non existent and really underwhelming. It makes me reluctant to place order especially during promotional periods as you just never know what you're going to get.\n",
    "I booked a next day delivery and the delivery company informed me that they wouldn’t be able to deliver it in the next 2 days! I contact asos and they keep telling me to wait and then if I didn’t received it in 2 days for me to ask the refund of the delivery amount. lol. I paid for next day delivery, if I wanted 3 days delivery I wouldn’t have to pay!useless service\n",
    "Unfortunately a bad review. Shopped with asos for years and never had problems. Today I have received an expensive genuine leather trench coat and part of the coat is missing on the cuff. I have contacted asos and advised that it is the last item and I still want the item and will somehow find a way to sort it as it’s exactly what I wanted. Been told I have to return it or pay full price. I said I bought it on one of their discounts so even if it ever came back in stock I would have to pay nearly £40 extra. Still wouldn’t help. So now I’m stuck with a coat that’s faulty and paying a lot for and they won’t partial refund just to cover the cost of the trying to fix it. Not impressed. Will be taking further.\n",
    "Made an order on monday next day delivery still hasn't arrived by the following sunday it won't let me contact any person in customer service just puts me on a virtual assistant that gives a automated response to any questions about where my order is will never be ordering anything again after this!!\n",
    "ASOS REVIEW.   ORDER NUMBER 7762We placed an order on 22nd April 2023 for goods worth £32.63p.  Our order never arrived and ASOS suggested this was due to circumstances beyond their control but eventually offered a refund of 50 percent of the purchase price.  We refused this offer and we’ve instead been offered 90 percent of the purchase price.  However, since our order we have written 39 emails and have been assured on so many occasions that our refund is being processed.  These are automated replies and are therefore meaningless. Customer Services may be very polite but what good is that if they do nothing to reimburse the customer for a refund legitimately owed. However, these promises have proved to be empty gestures and ASOS cannot be either believed or trusted.ASOS may not be a scam Company but they are willing to take your money but not to fulfil their obligations.  I would certainly not use this Company again nor would I recommend this Company to anybody else.  I would not touch them again with barge pole!In terms of a review of their service I would give them 0 out of 10!  I will continue to email ASOS until they pay the refund.\n",
    "Ordered a pair of trainers from ASOS. They supplied a tracking number which was incorrect. I contacted customer services via live chat to tell them about the issue, they said I had to wait for an update which never happened. Had to contact Customer Service again, who said I would have to wait 12 days before I could get a refund just in case they arrived. On the 12th day I had to contact customer services again for the fourth time to receive my refund. Awful experience.\n",
    "I like that Asos usually reacts fast and sorts out things in a good way, but I think something is wrong with their promo codes. How can I receive a promo that \"doesn't work\" in my country? Is it a joke - I spend 2 hours arranging my basket and then find out at checkout that the promo is not working and customer service says it doesn't work in either of the two regions I am able to order from. Smells like cheating- we encourage you to buy using the discount code, but then we tell you it's not working, hoping that you will still place your order.\n",
    "I ordered a wedding dress from them, £150 dress. It arrived with a faulty zipper. There wasn’t another size to replace it with so I contacted their chat. I was told\n",
    "\n",
    "ASOS\n",
    "[09:58:46] As I can check you love the dress but there is a fault in the dress, you can get it repaired from yourself. Just keep the receipt/bill with you and reach out to us. We'll help you with the refund of the repair cost as well. Sounds good?\n",
    "\n",
    "So I did just that. I paid for the repair, fronted the cost, dress got repaired and then they declined to give me the refund and close every chat I open. Not sure what company is able to lie to their customers but honestly its appalling\n",
    "Always on time, perfect site\n",
    "Really helpful, solved my issue under 5 minutes. Really professional agent.\n",
    "Best of ASOS: great customer service *items are reserved in basket for an hour so you know its in stock!!!! *Variety of style and brands *ASOS own stuff also pretty*fast dispatch *delivery almost always comes early\n",
    "\n",
    "I have got some great clothes since I started using this company this year.The customer care is usually great. I have had no need until now to contact them directly. Unfortunately last few orders I have had to return. Some brands are American so sizes just too big! The app doesn't give general sizing guidelines like H&M and Ann summers. So hot and miss. The sizing consistency is poor unless using known brands like Topshop and New look. Have had other smart clothes from brands but it's a risk. I'm waiting for a £100+ refund and I can't even exchange!?. I got these clothes for a reason and now I can't shop elsewhere because they still have my money.\n",
    "\n",
    "I got refunded after getting through to an agent. They made note of my issues with sizing and sizing guide that confused with 2 different orders I placed on my account. I will just try stuff on in shop for time being though.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I got jeans and tops actually in a shop! Worth full price for convenience. Got some deals in black friday sales including a bag for Xmas and a dress for when it gets warmer and I'm going somewhere esp nice..... Hope it goes smoothly.... I received my dress a day early. Really pleased with it :) still waiting on bag but it's being departed from brand itself. It said in estimated delivery it would be later. Sooo excited!!! Bag turned up today. My daughter be so happy. Thank you 🎁 love that asos reserves items in your basket.\n",
    "Bhupender is really good person who helped me so quickly and was very kind. Thank you.\n",
    "Excellent very fast and efficient service\n",
    "The customer service person was helpful, unfortunately my order hasn't arrived on time but gave helpful responses.\n",
    "Straight to the point and easy to communicate\n",
    "Have always shopped with Asos but recently it has become diabolical, spend 30 minutes on live chat, tell you issue sorted, but isn't, what is the point of live chat if you do not listen Asos\n",
    "Rocky was a great customer support advisor and helped me with my order.\n",
    "Asos delivered my package to the wrong address. At first they tried to gaslight me, saying that they can see my default address was incorrect. I sent them a screenshot, showing the confirmation email which showed I ordered the items to the correct address. Then it was like pulling teeth trying to get them to give me a straight answer as to getting and refund or the package resent.\n",
    "I did all the checking the order over and explaining the situation to them, they just faffed about asking me silly questions like if I would be comfortable going to the address they delivered it to and asking if they had the package. So ridiculous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually after talking with them for over an hour they agreed to see if they could sort it out. I spoke to.3 different customer support agents and the were all friendly but they definitely need to make it easier to get a refund when asos is at fault.\n",
    "\n",
    "They tried to blame the courier when it was definitely not the couriers fault. Just trying to pass the problem on to someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also premium delivery has never arrived the next day for me. It has always taken 2 days.\n",
    "I had the most amazing customer service with Bervirlly!! Such an incredible person. Was super friendly, easy to talk to and was quick to help me find solutions and sort out the issues super fast! Compared to other people I’ve spoken to, Bervilly is honestly exceptional!\n",
    "Raylene was very helpful and quick to assist and to respond. A great team member!\n",
    "Jonathan was helpful, efficient and listened to me my concerns. And he solved my problems very quickly\n",
    "Advisor was rude and unhelpful. Irrespective of the end result (ie the product was priced incorrectly) I was more annoyed at how abrupt and matter of fact the advisor was. A poor brand representative for ASOS.\n",
    "Chatted to Julyan on customer service about a left of centre opportunity to perform with ASOS at a London pop-up. He was very helpful and I am pleased with the service!\n",
    "Quality products,fast delivery and prompt response to issues\n",
    "Disgusting company . I pay for next day delivery. A week later I’m still waiting for my parcel . Which is lost by Evri. Instead of refunding me as they should . This disgusting company Ste making me wait while rubbish Evri investigate. I’m what world is this MY problem??? Raising an official complaint\n",
    "my account has been blocked and my account closed for no reason!\n",
    "The person I was chatting to was very helpful and ensured he resolved my issue\n",
    "Obviously the best customer support service I've seen, very operative and fair solutions.\n",
    "Used to be a great company. Not any more. Issues with refunds. Wrong items sent. Poor customer service\n",
    "I’ve used ASOS many times before and it’s been great. However, don’t bother buying the Premier delivery as there is no guarantee it will turn up next day as promised. Customer Services are no help, just keep saying it will be delivered on the day, even at 11.50pm! So frustrating as I’ve always regularly bought from ASOS. Doubt I will again.\n",
    "I sent two items back for a refund (payment via Klarna). The items were from different orders and I sent them back in the same bag and notified asos I’d be doing that via the return process on the app. I also followed the return process on Klarna too.\n",
    "I received a refund for one item only.\n",
    "Contacted asos and was told a refund would be processed and reflected on my account within 10 working days and I’d receive an email.\n",
    "Contacted asos again a few days later as not heard anything (no email) and was assured the refund was being sent.\n",
    "Day 12 and still nothing, no email either. Contacted asos again, they informed me the refund didn’t go through as there was a server issue and the refund had now been processed it would take another 5-10 working days and I’d receive an email with 24 hours.\n",
    "No mention on the servers being down and the refund not going through when I contacted them the second time.\n",
    "Hopefully that’s now it and I don’t need to contact asos again - but we’ll see.\n",
    "I think a company like asos would have checks and balances when the servers go down (if that’s in fact what happened), some automation / workflows of when things are ‘stuck’ and haven’t been fulfilled or completed. If anything so I’m not having to contact again and so refunds are paid within the timescales they state / anything else that may have been affected by the servers going down.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m normally a happy shopper with asos, which makes this experience even more frustrating as I normally having nothing but praise for asos. Unfortunately this situation falls far below my expectations for asos.\n",
    "I ordered two pair shoes in size 42. When my order arrived the shoes was in size 41 and too small. I then contacted their customer service, who said they would send replacement order with the right size with express delivery - now 12 days later and several contacts with customer service, I still haven't received my replacement order... every time the same answer... wait another 4-5 days. Useless customer service\n",
    "Shopped here for years but was shocked to be told I would not receive a refund for a pair of jeans I returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ordered them with other items and got 20% off during a deal they ran on their website. Because the total price of the jeans was less than 20% off the entire order, they refused to refund me. They claimed the jeans where basically \"free\". If they offer 20% off they should accept their losses and look after their loyal customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Spoke to two customer services people. One was wonderful but the other was rude and scarcastic.\n",
    "Customer service chat is nothing but a shambles, been cut off 4 occasions and was lucky enough to speak to the same advisors of 2 separately occasions, and still no help what so ever, always blaming you for disconnection even thou the chat is still running, delaying responses its a shambles to say the least, got help it if you need them for anything urgent, would advise to stay away\n",
    "Daries was so helpful! Could not fault. What a nice man!\n",
    "Very helpful my parcel went missing\n",
    "Got issued a refund straight away\n",

    "\n",
    "What is the issue - refunds. I do everything I am supposed to do but always end up chasing my refund which should not be the case. This has happened 3 times now. I am seriously considering whether I should bother ordering from ASOS anymore.\n",
    "ordered a jacket and it had problem with delievery and went back to asos, i spoke to the chat online and they cancelled order and refunded without me saying i wanted to. now i cant get the same discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "customer service is terrible\n",
    "I pay for premium next day delivery but Evri fails to deliver my Asos orders every time and reschedules it 4 or 5 times. Sometimes the parcel is lost.for 4 days in a row. This happens with every Asos parcel I order. I always have to contact your customer support who tell me to wait another two days. But with this happening consistently on every order I feel like I should just cancel my Asos subscription because nothing ever arrives next day so there is no point and Asos's customer support is pretty poor and does nothing to help. Such a shame as I used to really love Asos and always rated their service. Asos, please fire Evri and use a better service that will treat your customers right.\n",
    "ASOS Customer Service made it very easy to report an undelivered item. It was very quick and effortless - they offered a replacement/refund right away. Great customer care when these situations arise.\n",
    "Felt like I was a criminal because Evri can’t deliver to right address\n",
    "Gangadeep from Asos resolved my problem very\n",
    "Efficiently\n",
    "Assistant was very helpful.  Although they couldn't assist with my lost parcel by EVRi and I had to wait for EVri to look into it the matter, ASOS tried their best. Unfortunately unreliable courier service.\n",
    "I’m resentful about not being refunded the full amount I paid for an item. Seems like common sense, especially considering ASOS doesn’t do exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat associate was not empathetic, this comment sounded sarcastic:\n",
    "\n",
    "“I appreciate that this may not be the outcome you were hoping for, but it is all I’m able to do for you.\n",
    "Just wanted to give a big shoutout to the customer service team for helping me with a refund. They were super fast and friendly throughout the whole process. I had some concerns initially, but they made it easy and stress-free. The refund was processes without any hassle, and I couln'dt be happier.\n",
    "Ashu was extremely helpful and dealt with my issue with ease\n",
    "Easy and straight forward to use, my issue has been resolved (given the refund arrives) happy with the service.\n",
    "Absolutely disgusting! I returned two Timberland boots that were £270 (within the timeframe) my account has been deactivated (for making too many returns, even though they’re an online retailer) and they are refusing to refund my money. How can they just keep the boots and my money? £270 worth, absolutely outrageous! I can’t get hold of anybody to speak to on the phone and when using their chat system, customer service keeps saying my complaint has been escalated. I’ve been a loyal customer for several years with them!\n",
    "Great customer service, always able to resolve my query. Jessica was very helpful\n",

    "Jessica was wonderful in helping with all my questions and made the whole process quick and friendly. Definitely recommend.\n",
    "Very fast service! Thank you so much\n",
    "I will never order from ASOS again. I ordered multiple pairs of pants to try for a special occasion. I ended up keeping the one pair I liked the most and returned the rest. I tried all of them on at home, once, to make my decision, then repackaged them in their original packing. A few days later I got one pair back in the mail, covered in stains. I contacted customer service (which they make super difficult to do) and they said they would open a claim. I just got a response that they won't refund me for this item because I damaged them and they smelled of body odor. I'm honestly insulted. I'm not sure how the others wouldn't wreak of body odor if I tried them all on at the same time. And it's literally not possible that I could have stained them. I tried everything on at the same time, at home. I'm sure someone at the return processing center did this and instead of getting in trouble, blamed me for their mistake. And how can such a huge company not refund someone 30€. I will never order from such a company again. Customer service is nonexistent and they insulted me.\n",
    "Sold yet another faulty item. Supplied MERICAR with all the needed pics and information but he was not willing to help me any further with this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "So sick and tired of paying high end prices and low crap items. Avoid this company at all cost!\n",
    "ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! Never ever shopping with this scamming company again. It's a shame because ASOS has a wide range of a fashion, brands and has nice clothing, but it's hard to shop somewhere if most of the time you don't receive the items or they are delivered late.  I used to buy from ASOS all the time, and had no issues but the last couple years it's been horrendous. (PROBLEM 1- PARCEL WAS NEVER DELIVERED) I've had loads of problems with them in the past. One problem being the delivery driver saying they delivered my items , however, my video recording doorbell that tracks movement says other wise, I was also home all day and didn't have a knock on the door or anything,  they didn't even attempt to delivery it. I told ASOS and they accused me of lying. (PROBLEM 2- TOOK 2 MONTHS TO BE DELIVERED)Second issue , I'm all about giving second chances, so thought I'd try the company again. This time I'd ordered some things for my holiday, I had 9 working days until my holiday and the order type I used was 3-4 working days. My order was never delivered again within the time frame. I messaged them and they said it would come in 2 weeks bear in mind it was already a month late! Still didn't arrive on this second delivery date they gave, and in  the end asos had to resend the order, but sent me 2 items out of 12 because everything else had sold out! This arrived finally 2 months late. I ended up just returning it all because by that point I didn't want any of it and was fed up. ( PROBLEM 3 - DIDNT COME ND & ACCOUNT AND REFUSED REFUND)- Third issue, I ordered some over a year and a half  later because they had said they updated their courier etc. So I though oh okay sounds like they are improving! So  I d paid for £6 next day delivery, which firstly didn't come next day, it came 2 days late, I complained about this and after 2 hours and multiple different \" customer service \" advisors through, I managed to somehow get a refund for the delivery! ( usually ASOS aren't great at accepting their wrong doings and making it right). Anyways every time i did contact their customer service team, they were unhelpful and rude,  I had to contact them around 20 times  to get anywhere. I then got my items and thought that was that. but to my absolute dread I needed to make a return because some of the items were horrendous quality.so I went to do so with 5 days left until my return date expired, and they had locked my account for no reason! I hadn't been told why or anything. I contacted them about it, whilst also notifying them about the return expiry date too, they assured me they would make sure I would be able to return it since the locked account was their fault. They said. They put a note in my account about it. I contacted them again  after leaving it a couple days like they said, the account was unlocked but my return was not being accepted. I contacted them numerous times more about this and they said they will send my issue off to be sorted out by someone of a higher status and send me my return label in a couple days. This never happened, I messaged again asking about it and they said they need me to wait couple more days as I'm in a que. I did this. Couple more days go on again and no email response or label. I message them about this whole problem again, and now they are saying they can't send me the return label because the expiry dates expired. Obviously I knew this that's why I was messaging them!  They  should have known this  too since \" there a supposed note on my account\" and I've spoken to their team 20 odd times prior already about the issue, whilst constantly being reassured it's being sent. The person who I messaged next , responded saying they can't return the item for me because it's expired, and that's,  that and basically i should get over it, because the results not changing. She was rude and refused to help. I messaged someone else they said the same thing. But she sent me a return detail list, but stated u need to take this parcel to the post office instead and accept that you will have to  pay the return, and accept that we may refuse the refund when it gets to the warehouse. So in other words pay to send the items back, and then they will refuse to refund me which o know would of happened. So I w lookups have paid for return and lost the items and not got that return.  What's the point in that! Unreliable! Extremely disappointed. Complete scam. What type of  company locks a Customers account after a purchase,and does this  for the entire  period of the return and then unlocks it after the returns expired! All a bit premeditated to me. Absolutely disgusting behaviour. Heartbreaking that they must do this to so many other customers on a daily basis and can get away with it! Im just upset with myself for giving them another chance, I should've known.  I recommend everyone to spend their money else where not on  this sham of a company.\n",

    "I received someone else’s order. I had an event coming up for which I had ordered a pair of shoes and blazer which shows delivered on the app. The order number on the cover was different from mine, but shipping label had my address. Reaching a live person on chat is a hassle. The first customer service guy who started the chat abandoned it. The second person created a return label to return the incorrect order. Courier has not yet picked up the incorrect order (they called yday and said they will come today and nothing happened). Apparently refund will be issued only once they receive the incorrect shipping order although it was no fault of mine that they lost my actual order in transit. Extremely bummed that I did not receive the items I was eagerly waiting for. I commented about this issue on one of the brands instagram posts to get attention from a human and hopefully resolve the issue quicker but they reported my comment as spam when it wasn’t spam. I simply commented what happened and being a social media manager for a brand myself, it’s sad that ASOS would flag a comment instead of taking it up with customer care and resolving things. I will not be ordering again as this experience is not one that I want a repeat of. Still hoping and waiting for a resolution.\n",

    "I bought next day delivery for a year and have had issues on several occasions where my orders have not been next day or even 2 days late! I've also tried speaking with their chat service which is appalling. They do not ever offer any assistance with your issue, it's like a robot is speaking to you. They seem to just relay their policies back to you which you already know if you've read them... and never offer to help or acknowledge the issue you have. Terrible for a huge company like ASOS. I was also recently left out of pocket, with clothes that don't fit or I don't like, due to their inflexible returns policy even with medical issues - really unfair and also extremely unsustainable!\n",
    "Terrible customer service. I ordered some items and paid for the delivery by 12midday option. My notification said to expect delivery between 10.10 and 11.10. When 11.10 came I checked on the order and could see that it had been updated by DPD to say delivery had been made at 10.16 and been received by 'FHF' and a photo that of course could not be loaded. I tried to contact ASOS but there was no-one available so I phoned DPD and they said they would contact their driver and try and get him to come back and sort it. I said I was leaving the house at midday and had been told it needed to be signed for so didn't know how that would work. Luckily I have CCTV and was able to see the driver 'coming back' at just after 1pm and actually delivering my parcel (no need for a signature apparently!) so my guess he had clearly lied on the tracking to make it look like he's made his targets. He was also fairly quick for someone who had apparently made a drop over an hour and a half ago and so was presumably on the rest of his round, hmmmm. I get this was DPD's fault but when I explained all this to ASOS they didn't want to know, all they kept repeating parrot fashion was that the tracking said it had been delivered at 10.16 so there was nothing they could do. I offered to share my CCTV evidence, they didn't want to know. As it was, I had to return the whole parcel as it useless arriving later than I needed and so farcically and legally they should have to refund the postage anyway (at least the standard part) but they continue to fight it and the best they are willing to offer is a promo code. Believe me I won't be shopping with them again. So not only is their customer service awful but they don't know what they legally have to do!!!! Shameful.\n",
    "Really good experience with a faulty item I received. Very easy experience and stress free. Thank you!\n",

    "Bought £170.00 worth of items from ASOS, they failed to send 3 items to me so I let the customer service team know, they issued me a refund on 29th October, I paid for the all year around £10 delivery service - Bad move, they decided to block my account so I cannot log in or purchase from them again, I cannot even return the items I want to return that don't fit me from the items that did arrive!!\n",

    "I bought a pair of boots in March this year. After light wear the sole split all the way across. I returned them at the end of October looking for replacement or refund. I had the boots for 7 months. My return was rejected as I am apparently outwith the return time. Customers do have rights around faulty goods. But according to ASOS I appear to have no consumer rights around the sale of goods that go faulty in less than a year. The message I got even said not to try and return them again as they would again be rejected! Customer rights and services are non existent in ASOS. I will be taking this further and will never buy from them again.\n",
    "Amazing friendly service today got all the help I needed with patience and kindness\n",
    "Terrible customer service! I ordered a few items for my holiday on next day delivery, the items did not turn up the next day so I contacted asos. They told me it would arrive that day, I left it until the evening however it still didn’t arrive, so I contacted them again to be told don’t worry it will be here. It didn’t arrive so contacted them again to be advised they now need 48hours to be able to contact the delivery company, which I find strange as the day before it was instant! I asked for a complaint process to which they said we deal with it on live chat. Still no answer and now have to wait which is strange as not 24hours before the agents were able to contact the delivery company immediately!\n",
